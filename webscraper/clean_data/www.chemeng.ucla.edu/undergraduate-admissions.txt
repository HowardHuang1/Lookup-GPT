Mission Statement
Mission Statement of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
To educate future leaders in chemical engineering who effectively combine their broad knowledge of mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology with their engineering analysis and design skills for the creative solution of problems in chemical and biomolecular technology and for the synthesis of innovative (bio)chemical processes and products.
Objectives and Outcomes
Educational Objective
To produce chemical engineering alumni who:
Draw readily on a rigorous education in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology in addition to the fundamentals of chemical engineering to solve creatively problems in chemical, biochemical and biomolecular technology.
Incorporate social, ethical, environmental and economic considerations, including the concept of sustainable development, into chemical, biochemical and biomolecular engineering practice.
Work collaboratively in multidisciplinary teams to tackle complex multifaceted problems that may require different approaches and viewpoints to arrive at a successful solution.
Pursue careers in chemical, biochemical and biomolecular engineering and related fields as demonstrated by professional success at positions within industry, government, or academia.
Outcomes
Chemical engineering graduates will demonstrate:
an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering
an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data
an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability
an ability to function on multi-disciplinary team
an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems
an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility
an ability to communicate effectively
the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context
a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning
a knowledge of contemporary issues
an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice
