Boelter Hall
Boelter Hall is built on a hillside, so we are frequently asked, “How do I get out?” That depends on where you are going! If you enter or leave on the west side, the building entrances are on the first floor. To go to the Court of Sciences, and most of the north, south, and east campus, you can leave by the doors on the fifth floor: northeast or southeast corners, or the large doors on the central east facade.
To complicate matters, Boelter Hall is physically connected with the Math Sciences Building. The east and west hallways on the fifth floor will take you from Boelter to Math Sciences without going outside. Check the number of the room you are looking for, and whether it is in Math Sciences (north) or Boelter Hall (south).
Department Seminars
During the school year, the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department hosts seminars from visiting scholars nearly every week. It is usually held on Fridays at 10:00 am.
The only way to access The Penthouse is from the northwest corner of Boelter Hall, either by the northwest stairwell, or the northwest elevator. You can find this elevator while facing the department office on the fifth floor by turning left and going west down the hallway, away from the Court of Sciences.
