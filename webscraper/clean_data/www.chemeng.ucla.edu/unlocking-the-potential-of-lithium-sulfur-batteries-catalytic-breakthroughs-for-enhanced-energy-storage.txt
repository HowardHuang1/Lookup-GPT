Unlocking the Potential of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: Catalytic Breakthroughs for Enhanced Energy Storage
Feb 7, 2024
Growing demand for high-capacity batteries has led to extensive exploration of Lithium-Sulfur (LiS) battery technology. While the theoretical potential of LiS batteries is substantial, practical applications have faced challenges such as slow electrochemical reactions and sulfur loss during charge/discharge cycles.
Funded by the Center for Synthetic Control Across Length-scales for Advancing Rechargeables, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Basic Energy Sciences program, UCLA Professors Philippe Sautet and Xiangfeng Duan have focused on deciphering the complexities of the sulfur reduction reaction in LiS batteries.
