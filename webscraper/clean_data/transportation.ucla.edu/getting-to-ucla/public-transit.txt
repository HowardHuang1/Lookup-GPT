Rider Tips
Most public transit providers operate in the same manner and their services are easy to use if you follow a few simple guidelines.
Make sure you know what bus line you'll be taking.
It is quite possible for more than one bus line or service provider to arrive at the stop where you are waiting. Knowing the specific transit provider (e.g., Metro, Santa Monica, Culver City, LADOT) and the route name (e.g., Line 6 Sepulveda Blvd) is important. Be sure to note any special information regarding the route on the schedule, such as express or limited service.
Have enough cash on hand.
Better yet, get a Transit Access Pass (TAP) online through the
BruinTAP for Transit portal
. Most buses require exact change and may require an additional charge when you transfer to another bus or use an express route. Knowing the entire cost of your trip ahead of time will make it much easier when you board the bus.
Hail the bus like you would hail a cab.
Don’t assume that the driver will know you are waiting for their particular bus. Buses do not automatically stop at all posted locations. It is customary to signal the bus just as you would hail a cab. Once aboard, be sure to let the driver know you want to get off before you arrive at your destination. All buses have a cord or pressure strip you can activate to indicate you want to get off at the next posted stop.
Roll with it
. All the preparation in the world can be affected by weather, traffic accidents and other delays. Arrive for your bus at least five minutes before the schedule indicates and be prepared with an alternate plan in case you or the bus is delayed or canceled. If your commute is particularly time sensitive, try riding an earlier bus.
