BruinAccess
BruinAccess is a complimentary paratransit service provided by UCLA Transportation for qualified Bruins during academic weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. UCLA Transportation works in collaboration with the

to determine eligibility for the service.
BruinAccess offers curb-to-curb rides from most points within and near campus. The BruinAccess service area is south of Sunset Blvd., east of Veteran Ave., north of Wilshire Blvd., and west of Hilgard Ave. as seen on
