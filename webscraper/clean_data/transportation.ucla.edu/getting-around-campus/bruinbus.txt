Rooter Bus Schedule (Football/Baseball)
Whether it's football or baseball season, we want to help you enjoy every Bruin home game without the hassle of driving and parking, especially at the Rose Bowl. BruinBus offers convenient transportation from campus to the Rose Bowl or Jackie Robinson Stadium for all home games, plus the UCLA vs. USC football game when it's at the Coliseum.
Buses leave from the north side of the IM Field (Intramural Fields). Check-in for Rooter Bus is located at the northeast corner of Pauley Pavilion. For football games, the first bus departs 3 hours prior to kick-off and the last bus departs 2 hours prior. We drop off at the Rose Bowl in Lot B with return buses leaving from the same location. Return buses are available at the beginning of the second quarter (buses will leave when full). For baseball games, the first bus departs 1 hour prior to the start of the game.
Please reserve your tickets at the
Central Ticket Office
by 4:00 p.m. on the Wednesday of game week. So come join the fun and let us get you there in BruinBus style!
