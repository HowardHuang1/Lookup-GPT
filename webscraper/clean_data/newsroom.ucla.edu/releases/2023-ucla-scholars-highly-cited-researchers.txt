Forty UCLA faculty members have been named among the world’s most influential researchers in the sciences and social sciences.
The
Highly Cited Researchers list,
compiled annually by analytics firm Clarivate, identifies scholars whose work has been cited most often in papers published by other researchers in their fields over the past decade. Those chosen for the 2023 list have authored studies that rank in the top 1% in the number of scholarly citations worldwide.
“The Highly Cited Researchers list identifies and celebrates exceptional individual researchers at UCLA whose significant and broad influence in their fields translates to impact in their research community and innovations that make the world healthier, more sustainable and more secure,” said David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clavariate’s Institute for Scientific Information. “Their contributions resonate far beyond their individual achievements, strengthening the foundation of excellence and innovation in research.”
