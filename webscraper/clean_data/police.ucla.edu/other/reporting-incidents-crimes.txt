Reporting Incidents & Crimes
Whether you are a victim or a witness, you have the responsibility to report crime. If a crime occurs on or around campus, report it immediately to the police. Crimes in progress and crimes that have just occurred should be reported by dialing 9-1-1 from any phone. Whenever possible, the actual victim or witness of the crime should call directly. There are blue Emergency Phones located throughout campus and yellow Emergency Phones in the parking structures. The Emergency Phones are directly linked to UCLA PD. If you cannot speak, all you need to do is activate the line and the dispatcher will identify your location and send assistance.
Program the UCLA PD telephone number into your cell phone. If you have an emergency while in the campus area, call this number and let the dispatcher know you are on a cell phone and have an emergency. Some 9-1-1 calls from cell phones may go to Highway Patrol, potentially delaying a response.
When calling to report a crime or incident, please be ready to give information such as: a brief description of the occurrence, when and where the incident occurred, weapons the suspect(s) carried, where and when the suspect(s) was last seen, description of the suspect(s) and any other relevant information. In addition to the importance of reporting, timely information assists in developing information and warnings for the campus.
The UCLA Emergency Communications Center is staffed 24 hours a day by trained public safety dispatchers. The dispatchers receive calls from the 9-1-1 and business lines. They assign the appropriate police officers, firefighters, Paramedics/Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) or emergency workers to handle the calls.

or report incidents in person. The Department is located on campus at 601 Westwood Plaza. Individuals are encouraged to report crimes directly to the police. The Dean of Students, Ombuds Office, the Bruin Resource Center and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Center also are available to assist you with reporting.
