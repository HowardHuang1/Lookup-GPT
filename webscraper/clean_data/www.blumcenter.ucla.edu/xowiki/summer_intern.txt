UCLA Blum Center Summer Programs
UC Blum Federation & UCLA Blum Center Summer Scholars Program
Program Overview
The UCLA Blum Center Summer Scholars Program is a unique opportunity for outstanding graduate students to live in a region of Latin America and work with universities, international institutions or community organizations that are improving the health and social conditions faced by low-income and vulnerable populations in Latin America. UCLA Blum Summer Scholars support the development of specific community responses being implemented in Latin American communities faced with health-threatening conditions of poverty and other social determinants of health. Both UCLA faculty members and representatives from host organizations in Latin America provide mentorships for participating students. This program is funded by both the UC Blum Federation and UCLA Blum Center.
In 2016, Linda Shanley donated to the program in memory of her husband, John Shanley, MD. Her donations have been utilized to partially support students who will travel to Latin America to conduct mentored research under the UCLA Blum Center’s Summer Scholars field studies program. Scholars marked with an asterisk (*) have been funded thanks to her generous donation.
