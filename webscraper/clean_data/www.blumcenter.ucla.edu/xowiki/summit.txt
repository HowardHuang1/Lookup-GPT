Health inequities across the Americas persist, and in some cases, are widening. While health is
recognized as a fundamental human right, health inequities, which are avoidable, obstruct
individuals and communities from achieving their best health and development potential. To
understand and put forward proposals to address these inequities, the UCLA Blum Center on
Poverty and Health in Latin America, in collaboration with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
the UCL Institute of Health Equity, and the WORLD Policy Analysis Center will hold a two-day
summit during November 14-15, 2017. The Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (National Institute
of Public Health) of México will host the meetings at its Cuernavaca campus. Findings and
discussions from the Summit are intended to help inform policies that promote health equity in the
Americas.
Entitled Summit 2017: Health Equity in the Americas, this convening builds on the work of the PAHO
Commission on Equity and Health Inequalities in the Americas (the Commission) and will take
place in collaboration with leaders from countries of Latin America and North America. In addition,
the UCL Institute of Health Equity will lend expertise and the WORLD Policy Analysis Center will
bring comprehensive global social policy data to assist in examining potential solutions at a
national and regional scale to health inequities in order to reach our overarching goal of building
solutions for health equity across the Americas.
Summit Participants
Health leaders from 18 nations in the Americas and United Kingdom, with a focus on Latin America
Representing non-govermental / community organization, academia and government
Through interactive, action-oriented tracks, participants will build an Action Plan related to their track topics and will explore the steps for establishing an ongoing Action and Learning Network on Health Equity in the Americas.
