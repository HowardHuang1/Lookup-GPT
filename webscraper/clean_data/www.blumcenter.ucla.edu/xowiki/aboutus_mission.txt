History and Mission
History
In 2012, the UCLA Blum Center on Poverty and Health in Latin America became the third Blum Center within the University of California. Thanks to our founding benefactor, Regent Richard C. Blum and our founding director, Dr. Michael A. Rodriguez, the Center began its activities in research, policy and training to alleviate poverty and improve health among all Latin American populations. To complete its work, the Center collaborates with multi-disciplinary Centers throughout UCLA and institutions based in Latin America. Throughout its five-year history, the Center has built a rich cadre of organizations, experienced faculty, dedicated students and community leaders to help carry out the vision and mission of the Center.
