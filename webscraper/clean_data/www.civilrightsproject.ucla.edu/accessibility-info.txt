Accessibility Statement
We have undertaken to use our knowledge and understanding of the ways in which 
    different people access the Internet, to develop a web site that is clear and 
    simple for everybody to use.
Validation
We have used
XHTML
1.0 
    and
CSS
that conforms to 
    specification, as laid out by the
W3C
because we believe
    that usability and accessibility must have a solid foundation. 
    If anything on this web site does not validate correctly, please contact the
Site Administration
, 
    and not the Plone Team.
We have also endeavoured to achieve AA accessibility as measured against 
    version 1.0 of the
WCAG
.
    We are aware however, that a number of the checkpoints of the
WCAG
are 
    subjective — and although we are sure that we have met them squarely,
    there may be instances where interpretation may vary.
