As part of our effort to support an infrastructure of collaboration between researchers, lawyers and advocates, we believe in the importance for The Civil Rights Project to conduct conferences, briefings and trainings.
Many of our conferences are envisioned to foster debate and draw experts from several distinct areas, commissioned for further research by The Civil Rights Project.

Book Launch & Roundtable for The Walls Around Opportunity: The Failure of Color Blind Policy for Higher Education

Join us on September 13th in person at UCLA or virtually to celebrate the timely book launch of The Walls Around Opportunity:  The Failure of Color Blind Policy for Higher Education by Co-director Gary Orfield.  For many young people, racial inequality puts them at a disadvantage from early childhood. The Walls around Opportunity argues that colorblind policies have made college inaccessible to a large share of students of color and reveals how policies that acknowledge racial inequalities and set racial equality goals can succeed where colorblindness has failed.

The Civil Rights Project and partners held a working meeting for invited participants on Equity in Dual Language Immersion Education in December 2018.  Dual language programs, especially two-way, hold enormous promise for English learners as well as others if they are developed and implemented in an equitable way.  An ongoing dialogue was organized with the goal to discuss and address concerns about the degree to which all communities are effectively served by these programs.

How are public schools and teachers being affected by the Trump administration's immigration policies? What can public schools do to protect their students? What can we do to ensure that our schools are safe spaces for all students? This interdisciplinary panel addresses such questions by drawing on two national studies by Professors Patricia Gándara and John Rogers and they will be joined by Michael Newman, California Department of Justice, Civil Rights Enforcement Section, and Thomas Saenz, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The panelists also examine the impact of the Trump administration's policies and political rhetoric on the experience of immigrant youth and the children of immigrant parents in U.S. public schools.
