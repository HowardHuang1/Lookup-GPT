We generate and synthesize research on key civil rights and equal opportunity policies that have been neglected or overlooked.
The Civil Rights Project uses research as the foundation for a wide variety of written products. These are designed to define and accentuate the racial justice implications of key policy choices to legislators, the media, and the general public, and to arm civil rights organizations with the intellectual capital they need to become more influential at the national, state and local levels. To date, CRP has commissioned or produced over 400 studies on a range of topics, some of which include:
Impacts of the elimination of the use of
affirmative action
in
higher education admissions decisions
in several states
Benefits of
racial diversity
in K-16 education
Impacts of
Title I
and
No Child Left Behind
(NCLB)
reforms on
K-12 education
, and particularly on minority children
Alignment of the civil rights and
standards-based school reform
agendas
High stakes testing
The relationship between religion and civil rights goals and advocacy
Racial disparities in
school discipline
and
special education
practices
School resegregation trends
and remedies
Dropout trends
and remedies
Long-term implications of the country's rapidly changing demographics, especially in
suburbs and metro areas
Unique crises confronting underrepresented populations
Effective educational policies for
language minority students
(English Language Learners)
With our efforts we hope to improve the channels of communication through which research findings are translated and communicated to advocates, policymakers and the broader public and, conversely, to improve the channels through which the needs of policymakers and advocates are communicated to researchers.
