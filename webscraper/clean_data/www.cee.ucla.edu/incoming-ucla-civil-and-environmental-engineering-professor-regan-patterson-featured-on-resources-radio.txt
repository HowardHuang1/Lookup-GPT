Incoming UCLA Civil and Environmental Engineering Professor Regan Patterson Featured on Resources Radio
Jun 23, 2022
Assistant professor Regan Patterson was recently featured on Resources for the Future’s (
RFF
) Resources Radio, in the
episode entitled, “Driving Toward Justice: Transportation and Equity.”
From the podcast:
Patterson asks, “Transit is essential for those who keep our cities running. Other cities are also experimenting with similar fare-free transit programs. That, to me, is a really innovative approach. Can we treat public transit as a public good, and therefore have it free for everyone?”
