Description:
Plentiful high-quality water is fundamental for society. However, drought, climate change, contamination and growing populations pose challenges for water sustainability. Engineers are needed worldwide to find novel solutions providing access to clean water. Key elements in this degree program are surface and groundwater processes, hydroclimatology, watershed response to disturbance, remote sensing for hydrologic applications, membrane separation in aqueous systems, aquatic chemistry, environmental microbiology, and the chemical fate, geochemical modeling, and transport of contaminants in the environment.
