: “We need to find a balance between doing what is necessary to address the climate circumstance that surrounds us but at the same time being responsible that we do no harm,” Sant said.
From the Los Angeles Times article,
“Could removing carbon from the ocean be a climate change solution?”
: “The oceans are the world’s largest sink of carbon dioxide emissions,” Sant said. “The ability to couple an engineering intervention with such an incredibly large natural system is one of the only ways we’re going to be able to tackle a problem this large, in terms of size and scale.”
