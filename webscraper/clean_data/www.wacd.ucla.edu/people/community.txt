Our Community
Our faculty and students are committed to promoting positive social change through interdisciplinary modes of investigation that address the complex cultural and artistic issues in our multi-layered contemporary world.
Our rigorous and innovative program has well prepared former graduate students for careers in academia, on the stage, and beyond. Undergraduates and graduates make careers in community non-profits and activist groups, government arts agencies, museums, and arts foundations. Potential careers for Ph.D. and M.F.A. graduates also include positions in research universities and colleges. M.F.A. graduates are active as choreographers/performers in their own companies or with other professional organizations. All students can also excel in other fields including technology and the arts, videography, documentary work, public service, education, theatrical/events production, performing arts, urban planning, law, environmental activism, public health, and more.
To support our work, scholars and artists in World Arts and Cultures/Dance have received prestigious fellowships to support from: the Ford Foundation, the Fulbright Program, Guggenheim Foundation, the MacArthur Program, the Mellon Foundation, the National Association of University Women and the University of California President's Postdoctoral Program.
