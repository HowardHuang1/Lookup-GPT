M.F.A. in Choreographic Inquiry
We promote adventurous choreographic experimentation while engaging with global discourses around the body and performance.
The two-year M.F.A. degree is designed for students who wish to pursue a professional choreographic career. Students are encouraged to investigate theories of culture and performance as they relate to artistic work. Interests in interculturalism and multi-disciplinarity also are encouraged. These interests may be pursued in consultation with faculty advisers. See the full
