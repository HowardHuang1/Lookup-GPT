WACD Welcomes Bijayini Satpathy
Considered a foremost artist of Odissi, Bijayini Satpathy has four decades of intensive practice in the dance as a performer, educator and research scholar. Bijayini’s career as an award-winning Odissi dancer began in Bhubaneshwar, India and flourished at Nrityagram (a renowned dance education center and peforming ensemble), until 2018. Bijayini’s journey in choreography began with “Abhipsaa - A Seeking,” commissioned by Duke Performances, Baryshnikov Arts Center, and the New England Foundation for the Arts’ National Dance Project in 2020. Bijayini was the New York Dance and Performance Bessie Award Honoree in 2020, an Artist-in-Residence with Live Arts at the Metropolitan Museum in 2021-22 and one of the 2023 Dance Magazine award recipients. She is currently a resident fellow at The Center for Ballet and the Arts at New York University.
