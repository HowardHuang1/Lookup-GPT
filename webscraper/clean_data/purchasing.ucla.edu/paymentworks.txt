PaymentWorks
PaymentWorks is UCLA’s
vendor management tool
. It allows UCLA to efficiently obtain business details and payment information. U
se this page as your guide to the registration process!
Registration Overview
The entire registration process typically takes two to four weeks.
UCLA sends email invitation to the vendor via PaymentWorks.
Once they have received the PaymentWorks invitation, the vendor submits their information.
PaymentWorks verifies and validates the vendor’s submitted details.
Once verification takes place, the vendor information is routed to the UCLA Vendor Management team for review and approval.
Vendor Management assigns the vendor’s ID/number (i.e., Vendor Control Key (VCK)).
