Chancellor Quote Block
Serving as UCLA’s chancellor since 2007 has been the greatest honor of my life. And so it is with bittersweet feelings that I would like to share my decision to step down from the role at the end of the 2023-24 academic year. UCLA is a shining example of the best of public higher education, and I have every confidence that the university is well positioned for an exceptionally bright future.”
— Gene Block, UCLA Chancellor
