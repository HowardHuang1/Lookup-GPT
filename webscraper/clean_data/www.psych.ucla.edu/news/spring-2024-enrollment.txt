The
Spring 2024 Schedule of Classes
is available for you to review so you can plan your Winter quarter schedule. Enrollment appointments are
based on class standing
and are scheduled by the UCLA Registrar. Please make sure to check your enrollment appointments through MyUCLA, and set a reminder for when your enrollment passes open.
If you miss your first pass enrollment, you will have to wait until your second pass to enroll in courses.
For more information about enrollment, please
visit the Psychology Department’s website
.
The Psychology Advising Office is offering Spring 2024 Enrollment Workshops to provide enrollment assistance. These workshops will be offered on various dates/times, but will all cover the same information. The workshops will review general enrollment information, Psychology course enrollment restrictions, and advice for constructing your Spring schedule. After the presentation ends, there will be time for a Q&A where students can ask Psychology Advisors follow-up questions related to enrolling in major coursework.
It is highly recommended you attend one of the enrollment workshops, as drop-in hours are limited.
