Postdoctoral Scholars in Psychology
Message from the Psychology Department Chair
The UCLA Department of Psychology includes a large group of postdoctoral scholars, typically 25-30 at a time. They play a central role in our Department – as researchers, as mentors and teachers in the labs and community settings where we do our research, and as contributors to our academic environment. In these roles, they expand and enrich the intellectual and personal diversity of our scholarly community. Our Department has launched several initiatives to enhance the experience of our postdocs and to advance their professional development. We intend membership in our Department to be a wonderful, formative, and memorable period in our postdocs’ careers.
