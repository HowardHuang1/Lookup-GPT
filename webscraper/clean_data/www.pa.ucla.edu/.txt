FROM THE LARGEST TO THE SMALLEST:
THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING IN IT
The areas embraced by UCLA physics research span the range from the well-established disciplines of "big science," e.g. studying the Higgs Boson at the LHC, and frontier 
      plasma science underpinning fusion energy to newly emerging fields such as the physics of neuroscience and quantum science.
In astronomy, UCLA faculty are pioneers in the areas of extra-solar system planets, galactic astronomy, and cosmology. This effort is uniquely enabled by the world-renowned 
      capabilities in design and construction of infrared instrumentation by our Infrared Laboratory.
