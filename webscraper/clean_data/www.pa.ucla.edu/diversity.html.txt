Physics & Astronomy diversity policies
The UCLA Physics & Astronomy Department is committed to promoting and fostering an inclusive environment to serve our diverse community of learners.
We are committed to promoting and fostering a diverse and inclusive environment of learners for basic fairness and because diversity fosters 
      innovation. We are dedicated to supporting and engaging faculty and students from a broad array of backgrounds and experiences to tackle some of 
      the biggest questions in physics and astronomy. The Department strives for an environment of respect for all its members, who share the common 
      purpose of the study of physics and astronomy.
The UCLA Physics & Astronomy Department, in accordance with the policy of the University of California, is deeply committed to promoting and 
      fostering an inclusive community dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and creativity. We strive to maintain an environment in which all 
      members of our department can work and learn together in an atmosphere free of sexual harassment, exploitation, or intimidation. Please see the

These websites provide information regarding resources for issues such as discrimination prevention, title IX, student affairs programs, and other resources. There are also educational links which have information about implicit bias, stereotype threat, and classroom climate. I think the discrimination prevention team could be a valuable resource because they investigate discrimination claims made by students, staff, or faculty. They also hold training to prevent discrimination and bias.
