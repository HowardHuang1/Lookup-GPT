Chair's Discretionary Fund: Physics & Astronomy
Center for Biological Physics
Donating to the Department
The Physics and Astronomy Chair's Discretionary Fund
is an extremely valuable source of funds for 
      our department, permitting flexible, timely, and effective responses to the challenges of maintaining a world-class teaching and research environment. 
      It directly supports many important initiatives that are unique to our department and have a wide-ranging impact on our students, 
      faculty and also on the community. The link allows you to make your donation in honor or memory of someone.
Other opportunities include creating graduate student fellowships, distinguished ("named") postdoctoral fellow appointments, providing a permanent fund for maintenance 
      of the planetarium theater, developing a permanent endowment of summer research funds for our undergraduates, and purchasing a state-of-the-art computer-controlled mill 
      for the Machine Shop/ Instrument Fabrication Facility.  In addition, all research groups such as biological physics, the galactic center group, the particle theory group, 
      and others would appreciate your support. Please contact
