UCLA learning communities
UCLA is home to a growing number of groups devoted to exploring different aspects of teaching. These learning communities, or communities 
      of practice, are forums for discussing common interests, learning from colleagues, and sparking initiatives. They are a vibrant part of 
      our campus’s teaching and learning ecosystem.
