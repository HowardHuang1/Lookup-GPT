Behavioral Wellness Center
WELCOME TO THE BEHAVIORAL WELLNESS CENTER (BWC)
The Behavioral Wellness Center is committed to ensuring that you remain mentally healthy while completing your training program with the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.
The BWC is committed to practicing in a way that recognizes how racial, political, cultural, and spiritual processes operate on implicit, explicit, institutional, and individual levels to impact minoritized populations, populations of color, and LGBTQ communities' experiences. Behavioral Wellness Center staff at David Geffen School of Medicine are comprised of professionals from diverse cultures and backgrounds. Our clinicians have experience with mental health issues, and offer expertise in a variety of modalities to improve well-being.
Our services are confidential. All contact with the Behavioral Wellness Center is maintained separately from the David Geffen School of Medicine.
We offer in-person and telehealth services, with evening and weekend appointments available by request. Our office hours are Monday through Friday from 8:00 am – 5:00 pm. The general clinic line is
