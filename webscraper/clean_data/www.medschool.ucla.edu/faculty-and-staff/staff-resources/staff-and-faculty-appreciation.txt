CALL FOR IDEAS
Do you have an event, resource, or opportunity you'd like to have added? Let us know, we can't wait to collaborate with you.
Submit now
Day after day, our faculty and staff find new ways to embody our core values.
We all know those people who go above and beyond — who see a challenge as an opportunity, who remain kind and collaborative in the face of conflict, who exemplify the Cultural North Star in their work, actions, and interactions. Take a moment to recognize them! As an added bonus, you and the recipient will be automatically entered into a Cultural North Star drawing.
