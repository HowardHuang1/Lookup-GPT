Medical Education Fellowships (MEF)
Continuous improvement in medical education
Our goal for the Medical Education Fellowships is to have faculty members prepared to take on educational leadership roles to lead these efforts.
The 2023-2024 Medical Education Fellowship 1 cohort in the Geffen Hall with MEF Leadership, Clarence H. Braddock III, MD, MPH, MACP,​ Executive Vice Dean and Vice Dean for Education and MEF faculty, Catherine Nameth, PhD and Erin Powers, MEd.
Overview & Background of Medical Education Fellowships
There are continuous calls for quality improvement in content, process, and outcomes of medical education across the continuum, from undergraduate training, residency training to Continuing Medical Education (CME). With the goal of continuous improvement of medical education, it is important to have faculty members prepared to take on educational leadership roles to lead these efforts. These faculty members might be called upon to assist their departments in identifying essential learning objectives, designing effective educational experiences, improving assessment of performance, or evaluating the quality and impact of existing programs. Although faculty members have historically taken on this type of leadership without formal preparation, the Medical Education Fellowship is intended to develop needed competencies within medical education.
