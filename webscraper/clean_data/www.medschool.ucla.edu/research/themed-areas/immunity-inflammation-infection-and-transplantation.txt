UCLA’s Expertise In Immunology Ranges Far And Wide
Innovation at UCLA extends far beyond a moment of discovery.
UCLA faculty have developed best-in-class T-cell therapies for fighting and beating cancer and for world-leading transplant programs. They have uncovered and invented new ways to prevent and treat infection to meet the challenge of antibiotic resistance.
Their groundbreaking discoveries have unlocked the genetics and cell biology of immunity. Now, they are building mathematical models of human health. Here—now—we are harnessing the power of the immune system to prevent, treat, and cure disease.
Dr. Lili Yang
Engineered killer T cells could provide long-lasting immunity against cancer. UCLA researchers use stem cells to engineer cells that attack human tumors in mice.

Once we fully understand the rules of the immune system, then we can harness the immune system therapeutically to cure disease.
