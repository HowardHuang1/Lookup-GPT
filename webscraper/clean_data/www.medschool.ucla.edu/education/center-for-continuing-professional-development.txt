Welcome to UCLA CCPD

The Center for Continuing Professional Development
February 23, 2023
I am reaching out to you as the first Associate Dean of the Center for Continuing Professional Development (CCPD) to introduce the concept of our group, inform you of the changes that are occurring in the space of continuing medical education and invite your partnership.
The concept of continuing professional development (CPD) refers to the process of lifelong learning and self-improvement for healthcare professionals. This can include attending workshops, conferences, and seminars, participating in online courses and webinars, reading relevant literature and journals, and engaging in other activities that help to expand knowledge and skills in their field. The goal of CPD is to ensure that healthcare professionals stay up to date with the latest developments in their field and can provide the highest quality care to patients. The concept of professional development encompasses growth in the entirety of skills and knowledge needed to practice at the top of our profession. At the foundation is medical knowledge, addressed by continuing medical education but also continuous development of skills in leadership, ethics, health equity, care quality, management, and ethics. The CCPD will be the conduit for providing this content to our faculty and the medical community at large. Our vision is to be one of the national leaders in providing professional development content. The CCPD, in partnership with our most valued resource, the faculty of the David Geffen School of Medicine, will evolve over the next several years to build capacity and content to realize this vision.
Soon we will be reaching out to you, content experts across DGSOM and the larger UCLA community, to join us in the development of programming in both the live and virtual spaces. We look forward to your partnership on this journey!
Regards,
Charles C. Flippen II, MD
