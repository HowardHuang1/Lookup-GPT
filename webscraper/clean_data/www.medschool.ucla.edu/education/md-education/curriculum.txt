Training the Next Generation of Health Leaders
It’s not about a degree; it’s about a life of impact.
At the David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM) at UCLA, we use our medical school curriculum and we create an environment where students prepare for a future in which scientific knowledge, societal values, and human needs are ever-changing. To meet this challenge, our graduates hone skills to provide quality care for their patients, contribute to the growth of scientific knowledge, and continue learning throughout their careers.
Our Redesign Process
Our medical school curriculum is getting a full refresh. An exciting, collaborative effort between faculty, students, staff, and leadership with a refocus around our ‘why’ – To empower students to become physicians committed to excellence and leaders in innovation, research, health, education, advocacy, and humanistic care.
