DREW/UCLA
The Charles R. Drew/UCLA Medical Education Program was established in 1978 between the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in South Los Angeles and the UCLA School of Medicine. The program fosters the development of leaders who will advance medical practice and knowledge and are dedicated to social justice and health equity for underserved populations in the United States and abroad. Students complete the same curriculum, but also complete coursework focused on the care of diverse and disadvantaged populations, take clinical rotations at sites in underserved communities, and complete a thesis related to disparities in health.
The Drew/UCLA Medical Education Program is no longer accepting applications and will be transitioning after the Class of 2027 into the
Urban Health Equity Pathway
, a new chapter in the over 40-year partnership between the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA (DGSOM) and the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU).
