Student Life and Events
Where ambition meets joy
Explore your passions and interests in the most colorful city in the world.
The David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM) at UCLA is about more than just learning. Our medical students join student groups, care for local and global communities, and form lifelong bonds — all while gaining the skills they need to change the face of health and advance our commitment to justice, equity, and diversity inclusion.
Student Groups
From community clinics to wilderness medicine and everything in between, you’ll find exceptional things to experience and learn, with great friends to share it all with. At UCLA, there are over 80 medical student organizations to join.
Affinity Groups
Our JEDI-affiliated communities advocate for equity and inclusion for all DGSOM students, especially underrepresented in medicine (URiM) students.
