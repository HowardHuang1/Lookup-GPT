Educators: Faculty (Speaker), Moderator and Facilitator
This includes medical students, residents, fellows, non-physicians, and patients as speakers
Presenters are crucial to making an impact on the educational experience. Each intervention is designed to close an underlying professional practice gap. The Center for Continuing Professional Development (The Center for CPD/CCPD) partners with our planners to identify faculty/speakers who are subject-matter experts and represent diverse perspectives. We are committed to ensuring your success as a faculty speaker, facilitator, or moderator and the success of the course.
Preserving the integrity of our educational space, we rely on the partnership of our educators to comply with the following:
