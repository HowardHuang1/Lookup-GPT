Culture and Mission
Our people give our mission life and meaning
Community of Kindred Spirits
A vibrant, supportive culture is essential to advancing our mission to heal humankind.
We strive to provide an environment where connections thrive, where resources lead to innovation, and where every member of our community feels empowered to leverage their unique abilities to advance our shared goals.
We are a diverse and collaborative community of innovators, educators, healthcare providers, and life-long learners committed to creating world leaders.
See our mission and vision
We have the great opportunity at UCLA to work together in teams. Not just the faculty and researchers, but also trainees, staff, and administrators. That allows us to accomplish so much.
