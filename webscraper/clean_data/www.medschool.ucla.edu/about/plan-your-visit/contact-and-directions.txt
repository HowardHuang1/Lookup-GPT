Getting to Campus
By Plane
The closest major airport to UCLA is the Los Angeles International Airport, LAX. From LAX, take the 405 Freeway north to the Wilshire Blvd. East exit. Continue east on Wilshire for several blocks, moving into the left lane. Make a left turn on Westwood Blvd. and follow it into campus.
By Train
A train is coming to UCLA, but not until 2027 when the
Purple Line Extension
reaches Westwood. In the meantime, you can ride the
Expo Line
that runs from Downtown LA to Santa Monica along Exposition Blvd., allowing you to avoid the congestion of the 10 and enjoy the convenience of rail.
By Bus
Metro
: Metro Lines 2, 302 and 761 serve campus, or transfer from other Metro Bus lines.
Santa Monica Big Blue Bus
: Lines 1, 2, 3, 8 and 12 bring you to campus, or transfer from other lines.
Culver City Bus
: Line 6 brings you directly to campus, or transfer from Lines 1-5.
