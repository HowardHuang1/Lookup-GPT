Strategic mobilization to address a global pandemic
The path back to society will be found through innovative, collaborative, and strategic mobilization of the research enterprise. The clinical and research strengths of UCLA Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA position the university to make a transformative and enduring impact on this global pandemic. Together, we are mobilizing a systemwide strategy to understand the development of COVID-19 infection; determine its extent and spread; characterize the immune response, and discover life-saving treatments.
