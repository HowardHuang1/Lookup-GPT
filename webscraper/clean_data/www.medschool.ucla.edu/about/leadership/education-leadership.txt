Education Leadership
Humanistic learning
Creating world leaders in health and science.
We empower students and trainees to change the face of healthcare, enhance the research enterprise, and enhance equity in academic medicine.
Education at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA is about more than just learning. Our medical students, trainees, and postdocs care for local communities, make discoveries in the lab, and form lifelong bonds — all while gaining the skills they need to change the face of health and advance our commitment to justice, equity, and diversity inclusion.
