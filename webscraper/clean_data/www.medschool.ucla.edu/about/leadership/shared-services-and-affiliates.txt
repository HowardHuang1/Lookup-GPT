Shared Services and Affiliates
A network of support
It takes a village to bolster the success of a top academic institution.
We are enriched by our affiliate and partner programs across UCLA, at Charles R. Drew University, Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, and VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System.
Each of these programs provides unique opportunities for our students to enhance their education, our faculty to collaborate to advance the frontiers of knowledge, and for us to collectively address the healthcare needs of Los Angeles.
