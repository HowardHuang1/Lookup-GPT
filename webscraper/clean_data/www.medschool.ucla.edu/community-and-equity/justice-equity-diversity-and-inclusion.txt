Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion
JEDI
We have a responsibility to push for positive change.
At the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA (DGSOM), we believe that healthcare is a human right. We are educating the next generation of physicians, physician-scientists, and researchers with that belief in mind. Our core values of diversity and inclusion are inseparable from our institutional goals of excellence in all tenets of healthcare, research, education, and community engagement.
