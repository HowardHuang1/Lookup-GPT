ART in Med Ed Program
Anti-Racist Transformation (ART) in Medical Education
In 2021, the David Geffen School of Medicine was selected to participate in the Anti-Racist Transformation in Medical Education (ART in Med Ed) program. DGSOM’s selection for participation in the three-year
Anti-Racist Transformation in Medical Education
(ART in Med Ed) program, one of just 11 medical schools chosen, is a milestone in its journey toward anti-racism.
Sponsored by the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, in partnership with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, ART in Med Ed replicates a model developed by the Icahn School to dismantle systemic racism and bias in academic medicine.
The program aims to mitigate racism in the learning and work environment of medical schools through a formal management change process that is “lifelong, people-centered, incremental and nonlinear".
