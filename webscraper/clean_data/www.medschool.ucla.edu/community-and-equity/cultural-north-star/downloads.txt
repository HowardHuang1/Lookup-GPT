Mark
The Cultural North Star mark – both an abstract star and an arrow – represents a guiding light for the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. The mark uses overlapping colors that represent the three core pillars of the Cultural North Star; together, they combine to form a singular graphic. Please note: The mark should always be oriented vertically (i.e., it should not be rotated laterally).
