Celebrate the best of us
It's a win-win.

Offering positive recognition is a simple but transformative act
And the research agrees.
Studies have shown that feelings of gratitude activate areas of the brain correlated with moral cognition, rewards and positive emotion. For both the receiver and the sharer, benefits can include:
A
happier, more motivated brain
.
A
boost in performance, engagement and well-being
;
And a
stronger connection
to your colleagues
.
In other words, the more we engage in it, the more we gain from it.
Take a moment to recognize someone
We all know those people who go above and beyond – who see a challenge as an opportunity, who remain kind and collaborative in the face of conflict, who exemplify the Cultural North Star in their work, actions and interactions. So take a moment to recognize them! As an added bonus: You and the recipient will also be automatically entered into a Cultural North Star drawing!
