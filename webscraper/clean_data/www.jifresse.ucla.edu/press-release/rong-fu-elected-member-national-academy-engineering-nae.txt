Rong Fu elected a Member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE)
February 6, 2024
Prof. Rong Fu, Director of Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering (JIFRESSE), has been elected a Member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in recognition of her distinguished contributions to engineering “for methodologies that use satellite remote sensing to characterize and predict precipitation over land” (

).
Election to the National Academy of Engineering is among the highest professional distinctions accorded to an engineer. Academy membership honors those who have made outstanding contributions to "engineering research, practice, or education, including, where appropriate, significant contributions to the engineering literature" and to "the pioneering of new and developing fields of technology, making major advancements in traditional fields of engineering, or developing/implementing innovative approaches to engineering education." Election of new NAE members is the culmination of a yearlong process.
Prof. Rong Fu and other individuals in the newly elected class will be formally inducted during the NAE's annual meeting on Sept. 29, 2024.
Join us in congratulating Prof. Rong Fu!
