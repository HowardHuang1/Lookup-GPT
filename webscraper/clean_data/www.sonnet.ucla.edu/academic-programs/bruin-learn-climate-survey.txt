Bruin Learn Climate Survey
Bruin Learn
is the branded name for UCLA’s learning management system (LMS). An LMS is essentially a course-specific website that provides robust functionality such as discussion boards, document access, and automatically-graded quizzes. Bruin Learn is based on Instructure’s Canvas platform, and is part of the university’s overall effort to standardize information technology, including those tools used for instruction. With Bruin Learn, UCLA aligns with the other UC campuses, the Cal State University system, and CA community colleges in using Canvas, and this consolidation around a common platform for all state public higher education will enable students to more easily take courses intersegmentally.
As part of the rollout of Bruin Learn, the Bruin Learn Working Group (BLWG) was created to make informed improvements to the platform. The School of Nursing is represented in BLWG by Marisa Miller. As the BLWG Representative, Miller will a) collect faculty/staff feedback and inquiries regarding Bruin Learn, b) advise our Bruin Learn Center of Excellence on ways to improve the Bruin Learn experience, and c) inform faculty/staff of new quality improvements in Bruin Learn.
To gather feedback from faculty/staff users, a Qualtrics survey will distributed monthly and will be open for feedback one-week at a time. Click the below link to provide feedback.
