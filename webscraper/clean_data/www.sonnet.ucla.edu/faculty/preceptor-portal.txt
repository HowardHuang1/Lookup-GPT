Preceptors and Volunteer Assistant Clinical Professors (VACP) offer students individual perspectives and hands-on experience in a variety of health care settings and specialties. The cumulative effect of what these volunteers impart plays a significant role in the care any health system delivers.
Clinical preceptors/VACP are integral to the future of nursing:
They volunteer their time and energy, using education and training in an effort to assure that the profession grows and thrives
They provide students with learning experiences that prepare them for the role of expert care provider.
Preceptors can advance their career by becoming a UCLA Volunteer Assistant Clinical Professor by participating in CE opportunities, and collaborating on projects within the School of Nursing.
The full criteria for becoming a VACP is available here
