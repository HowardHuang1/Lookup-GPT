A message from the Department Chair
Welcome to the Department of Biological Chemistry! We are a basic science department in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Our research addresses the molecular mechanisms underlying fundamental processes in biology and disease. We apply genetic, biochemical, cell biological, computational and biophysical approaches to study stem cell biology, development, gene regulation, cell signaling, cancer biology, neurobiology, genetic variation and disease. Our ethos reflects and fosters a passion for discovery and curiosity and a commitment to excellence.
