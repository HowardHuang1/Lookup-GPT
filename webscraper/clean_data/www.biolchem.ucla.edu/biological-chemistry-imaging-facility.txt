Biological Chemistry Imaging Facility
General Information
Biological Chemistry Imaging Facility (BCIF) provides resources for data acquisition and analysis for radioactive, fluorescent, and photographic samples as well as digital imaging and document production. BCIF started operations in December 1994 as a small departmental facility. Over the years it grew into a core imaging facility serving the majority of departments and subdivisions of the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine.
BCIF provides round-the-clock access to a cluster of fluorescent scanning equipment such as Typhoons 9410 and 9400 Variable Mode Imagers, Licor Odyssey near infra red imager, as well as Gel Documentation systems, color printers, and high-resolution flat-bed scanners. In addition BCIF provides scientific data storage space on its
secure storage arrays to all participating labs, as well as access to a number of software packages for data analysis and digital data processing.
All equipment in the facility is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The facility operates on a walk-in basis and provides technical support and instructions during weekdays, primarily for new users. Each lab is provided with its own account and space on a file server.
BCIF Access
The Biological Chemistry Imaging Facility (BCIF) is under the David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM) umbrella and converted to AD / MEDNET only facility as of Monday, February 27, 2017.

BCIF Locations
BCIF has one location: 344C BSRB for labs located at the Bioscience Research Building
Fee Structure
The cost is as follows:
B&W Printing/Scanning – $0.07/print
Color Printing/Scanning – $0.20/print
Equipment
Typhoon™ 9410 and 9400 Variable Mode Imagers from GE Healthcare are the main equipment pieces at both BCIF locations. Typhoon imagers are versatile systems, which handle agarose and polyacrylamide gels, membranes, mounted or unmounted storage phosphor screens up to 35×43cm, microplates, microarrays, and
in situ
slides.
Storage phosphor
Direct blue-excited fluorescence (457 nm, 488 nm)
Direct green-excited fluorescence (532 nm)
Direct red-excited fluorescence (633 nm)
Chemiluminescence
Important Typhoon features:
Unique Typhoon property: Highly sensitive confocal optics enables direct and highly quantitative imaging of fluorescent Western blots without intermediate exposure to films or screens
Powerful excitation sources and confocal optics allow for the sensitive detection of very low-abundance targets
Red-, green-, and two blue-excitation wavelengths and a wide choice of emission filters enable imaging of a variety of fluorophores across visible spectrum
Automated four-color fluorescence scanning allows multiplexing of multiple targets in the same sample (i.e. Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5)
Storage phosphor autoradiography delivers high-resolution imaging and accurate quantitation of 3H,14C,125I, 32P, 33P, 35S, and other sources of ionizing radiation
Typhoon 9410 imager can image microarrays and in situ slides at 10 micron resolution
The Typhoon exhibits outstanding linearity (4-5 orders of magnitude), quantitative accuracy, and extremely low limits of detection
