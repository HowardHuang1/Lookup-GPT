Oral Presentations
For oral presentations, we are aiming for approximately 20 minutes per lab (15 minutes for talk and 5 minutes for questions), depending on the attendance response. A suggested format might consist of 15 minutes for talk and 5 minutes for questions. talks by graduate students and/or postdoctoral fellows. However, each lab may use their time allotment to present their work in any way they choose.

Poster Presentations
Poster sessions are valuable for more detailed discussions of experimental work and for providing students with opportunities for one-to-one interaction with our faculty.  There will be a poster contest this year. Prizes will be awarded for the best graduate and post-doc posters.
Notes for poster session
Poster boards are 48" x 36" and can be arranged vertically or horizontally. It has been suggested that posters should be  created with 48" tall  x 36" wide  dimensions and mounted with the long axis being vertical.
Every poster should make clear what is the specific question being asked. This could be by giving the answer as the poster title or by having a subtitle stating "The question asked is ... "
Posters should severely limit text and figures; less is more! That goes along with making the poster a specific detail and not a summary of all the work done by that student or lab. A poster is a story, not a thesis! The goal is for viewers in a general audience to comprehend and remember the poster.
Figures and text should be numbered to show the progression of the poster.
An abstract should be presented in large enough type to read at a distance.
The poster should answer simply these questions:
What is the question asked?
What is the experimental design to get an answer?
What results were obtained?
How are these results explained?
It is the job of the person standing by the poster to amplify why we/they care about this question and what are the next steps.
Please complete the information below.
