MCDB 196A & 196B: Proposal Guidelines
Proposals should be 1 – 2 pages, typed with 1-inch margins, single-spaced, and 11-pt Arial font
Proposals should have a heading that lists the following information:
Title of proposed project
Student name, UID, and email address (same one on file with the Registrar)
Faculty research mentor’s full name, department, and email address
The proposal should be written in your own words, reflecting your understanding of the project. If you utilize materials written by someone else, such as sections of a grant proposal or research article, make sure you cite them appropriately (include in-text citations plus a bibliography). It is a form of academic dishonesty to turn in material written by someone else without giving them proper credit.
The intent in writing a research project proposal is to convince a review panel such as the undergraduate curriculum committee that the topic and approach are sound and have a clear relationship to previous work in the same field. Students should spend considerable time thinking about their projects, discussing their projects with their research mentors, and producing multiple drafts of the proposal since the quality of this document influences whether or not the application is approved.
The proposed project should be appropriate in scope for a 20-week project (10 weeks in 196A plus 10 weeks in 196B) and reflect accomplishments expected by both student and faculty advisor.
A proposal should begin with a
problem statement
– a clear description of the larger problem within which the research project is situated.
A
description
of the project should follow. This should include a rationale for the project that incorporates existing bodies of literature (published works) that will set the project into context, showing how the proposed work builds upon previous studies. This discussion should set the stage for the
hypothesis(es)
to be tested. The description should incorporate specific aims explaining what you plan to accomplish and how. This section should include a succinct account of methods that will be used to generate data (how will the data be collected and subsequently analyzed?) as well as a justification for why this approach is appropriate (how does it address your hypothesis or address the research question?).
The
proposal must make clear the precise role that the
student
will play in the lab
, including how much and what part of the data collection will be completed.
The project should reasonably fit the research and writing components within a two-quarter framework imposed by 196A and 196B and require no less than 12 hours per week in the lab. The faculty advisor should provide an estimate of approximately how many
hours per week
(for the duration of one quarter) the proposed project is expected to involve. That estimate should be included in the project proposal.
Append the project proposal to the
undergraduate research
application & acknowledgement form
,
MCD BIO 196A contract signed by faculty advisor, faculty mentor agreement
with signatures from both student and faculty advisor, and submit materials to the online application form.
Project proposals will be reviewed by departmental curriculum committee.
Students will be informed of their decision within 2-3 weeks of submitting application.
NOTE: If you are submitting an MCD BIO 198A (Departmental Honors) contact to be taken along with 180A, please follow the proposal guidelines for a 198A project:
https://www.mcdb.ucla.edu/mcdb-198a-d-proposals/
.  Your proposal will be for a three-quarter project, instead of a two-quarter project.
