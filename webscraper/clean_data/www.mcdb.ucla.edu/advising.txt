Advising
MCDB Undergraduate Advisors:
Connie Firestone and Maggie Schmall
Office Location:
128 Hershey Hall and 126 Hershey Hall
E-mail:
undergradmcdb@lifesci.ucla.edu
Phone/voice mail:
Connie – (310) 825-7109, Maggie – (310) 267-5908
MCDB Undergraduate Counseling Office Hours:
Counseling is generally available on a drop-in basis from 9:00AM – 12:00PM and 1:30PM – 4:00PM.  Maggie Schmall is available on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  Connie Firestone is available on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
During Week 0, Week 1, Week 2, and finals week, there are lots of students who need help with enrollment and other types of acute issues. So if you just want to see us to plan future quarters, change your major to MCDB, or be cleared to graduate, it is a much better idea to plan to come in during Weeks 3-10 when we can give you more time.
Please note: Office hours above are subject to change at any time. Updated weekly schedules will be posted on our office doors (126 and 128 Hershey Hall). If the MCDB Undergraduate Office closes during hours when it is generally open, a message will be sent to the listserv.  You can sign-up for the listserv by following the instructions on our website (see “Undergraduate News” on the menu to the left).
