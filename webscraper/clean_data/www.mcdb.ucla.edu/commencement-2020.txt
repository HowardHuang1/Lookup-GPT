Welcome UCLA Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology Graduates!
My sincerest congratulations to the graduating class and your families. We consider the 2020 MCDB majors to be an outstanding, talented and resilient group, and we have high hopes for your futures. The MCDB commencement website was constructed during the final three weeks of quarter, and the arc of narratives span from the time when we were all safer at home into the current nation-wide protests for change. We are at a critical turning point in the social fabric that connects our lives and the injustices and inequities that have led us to this moment must be confronted and corrected. To the black, brown, underserved and marginalized students in our community, we see you, we appreciate you and we stand with you. As you all move forward into the next stage of your life journey I encourage you to think about the responsibility we have to the well-being of our communities, and I challenge you to make a lasting impact to improve the lives in the place where you live, to be kind and compassionate, and to change the world for the better.

Dear Graduating Seniors,
Congratulations on your incredible accomplishment! It has been such a pleasure getting to know and work with many of you in MCDB 60. I have learned so much from you all, and have watched in admiration as you have taken on new challenges, and new ways of thinking, with enthusiasm and ease. I am hopeful for the future, knowing that the hard decisions our society faces, which will impact the lives of so many, will be in your hands. My very best to you and your families on this special day.
– Dr. Katie Gallagher: Lecturer, MCDB 60
