Lab Safety Fundamentals Certificate – Effective Fall 2020
You no longer need to submit a safety certificate.  My UCLA will verify your safety training status when contract is created.  For more information see
Laboratory Safety
.
The seminars, MCDB 180A (2 units) and 180B (2 units) will be taken concurrently with MCDB 196A and 196B.  They will focus on presentation and discussion of the research literature and of each student’s independent research project, and are designed to further enhance your research experience and expose you to the process of scientific discovery by providing hands-on experience applying the scientific method.
How Will These Courses Be Applied To My Major Requirements?
MCDB 196A (4 units) – applied toward the MCDB electives
MCDB 196B (4 units) – fulfill the laboratory requirement
MCDB 180A/B (4 units) – applied toward the MCDB electives
Note:  The MCDB major allows up to 4 units of seminar credit to be applied to the major electives.  If you complete 180A/B and also take MCDB 191 to complete MCDB Departmental Honors requirements, the 191 seminar will not be applied toward the MCDB electives.
