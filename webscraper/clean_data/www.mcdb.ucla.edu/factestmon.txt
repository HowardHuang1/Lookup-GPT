We work to identify and understand new regulators of cellular infiltration into tissues; our ultimate goal is to enable their modulation to improve symptoms in diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity. We utilize fruit fly genetics for discovery and then apply in vivo imaging, biophysical approaches, mass spectrometry, metabolomics and high throughput sequencing to explore function. We extend these findings into vertebrate models; one current focus is a turbocharger of mitochondrial energy production and its importance for immunology and the brain.

Stem cells exist in most organs in the body and are responsible for tissue homeostasis and repair. These rare cells hold the promise of novel therapeutics for degenerative diseases for which there are currently no cures or even effective treatments. Many questions remain unanswered about how stem cell functions are regulated and how they are impacted by changes in the local and systemic environment during aging or in disease conditions. Using skeletal muscle and the resident muscle stem cells as a model system, our laboratory seeks to understand how stem cells function, how stem cells change with age, and how to restore youthful function to aged stem cells. We take a multi-omics approach to identify critical factors and pathways that regulate fundamental features and processes of muscle stem cells, including the maintenance of quiescence and self-renewal. We use gene editing approaches (CRISPR) both for screening and for specific genetic modifications to study stem cell function, and we develop genetically engineered mice for the purposes of cell labeling, lineage tracing, cell depletion, and bio-orthogonal chemistry. In addition to basic stem cell research, we have pre-clinical translational projects exploring mechanisms of disease progression and experimental therapeutics for muscular dystrophies, and tissue engineering approaches for functional restoration following muscle trauma.

Proper formation and growth of the calvaria is critical for the proper accommodation of the growing brain during embryonic and postnatal life.  Sustained calvarial bone growth relies on fibrous joints called sutures, which simultaneously act as a barrier between neighboring bones and a source of stem cells to grow bones. In a common congenital abnormality called craniosynostosis, sutures are lost and neighboring bones prematurely fuse, limiting brain growth. In the Farmer lab, we integrate multiple animal models (i.e. mice and zebrafish) with cutting edge genomic, genetic and imaging technologies to decipher the molecular and cellular basis of calvaria development.

Organismal form is the product of a complex suite of interacting developmental processes. Variation in these processes allows mammals to adapt to changing environments, but also generates congenital malformations in humans. Developmental variation therefore presents a unifying concept for evolutionary biology and biomedicine, whose understanding is critical to the success of both fields. My primary research goals are to determine how developmental variation interacts with environmental factors within a species to produce congenital malformations in humans, and among species to generate new evolutionary adaptations in mammals. To pursue these goals, I characterize developmental variation across biological scales, and interpret how this variation drives evolution and malformations in form. I incorporate data from fields from paleontology to mathematics to genomics to developmental biology. I also study multiple model and non-model mammals (e.g., mouse, bat, cat, deer, horse, pig, opossum). I use this approach to investigate three major topics: mammalian limb evolution and development, major evolutionary transformations during mammalian evolution, and mammalian sensory system evolution.

Principles of cell fate specification
As an embryo develops, it needs to generate a myriad of cell types, all in specific locations relative to each other and with correct abundances. Retina, for example, contains more than a hundred neuronal subtypes, organized into three layers of cell bodies and two layers of neuropil. These cell types have different features and frequencies and have to be tiled across the retina in a specific way to support the overall function of the tissue. This seemingly impossible task is accomplished during development with incredible robustness. All the instructions for making this intricate structure, as well as all the other tissues in the body, has to be encoded in the genome. So we hypothesize that the blueprints for making tissues like retina are compressible and involve relatively simple principles. Our goal is to identify these principles and utilize them to develop new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.
Our approach involves imaging based genetic barcoding for tracing the lineage and molecular history of individual cells, spatial transcriptomics for mapping cell states, computational modeling for interpreting the results, and synthetic biology for developing molecular tools to manipulate cell fate decisions.

Neurons are highly dynamics cells who produce complex networks of connections. These circuits are continuously refined by developmental events and in response to new experiences, but how do neuronal circuits first acquire their function at the point where none previously existed? What mechanisms then allow a nascent circuit to refine its connectivity and activity to produce coordinated output?
We are exploring these questions using the embryo of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model. With a combination of methods drawn from classical genetics, the state-of-the-art in quantitative imaging, and new approaches to manipulating single cells in vivo, we are mapping the emergence of functional circuitry in the embryo. While cell adhesion molecules and morphogen gradients may teach us how to 'wire' a brain, we are working to understand how to 'boot' one up.

Utpal Banerjee's laboratory studies the effects of systemic signals on the maintenance of blood progenitors in Drosophila. He also studies the role of metabolic pathways in the control of proliferation and differentiation in the preimplantation mouse embryo.
Signal Transduction and metabolic control in Hematopoietic Development, stress response and cancer
1. Blood Stem Cell Maintenance
Hematopoietic stem cells are maintained within a microenvironment where signals from a niche are important for the maintenance of quiescence within a precursor population. Lack of such a niche-derived signal will cause loss of 'stemness' resulting in increased proliferation and eventual differentiation. We study this phenomenon in the Drosophila hematopoietic organ using genetic technologies available in this model organism (see Martinez-Agosto et al., Genes & Devl., 2007 for a review).
We have shown that the 'stemness' of these cells is maintained through the combined action of a Niche Signal, generated by Hedgehog (Hh) (Mandal et al., Nature, 2007), a local signal generated by Wingless/Wnt (Sinenko et al., Dev. Cell., 2009) and a reverse signal from the differentiated cells to the stem cells that we have termed the Equilibrium Signal. Several important concepts underlying Drosophila blood development have allowed us to propose this system as an appropriate genetic model for vertebrate hematopoiesis and these molecular mechanisms are being explored in the laboratory.
2. Stress Response systems
Myeloid blood cells are ideal for the study of response to many kinds of stresses. Hypoxia-related factors and free radicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role both in hematopoietic development and in stress response (Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, Nature 2009). Similarly, the NF-kB derived inflammatory response plays a major role in the way blood cells respond to injury at distant sites. The emerging view from these studies is that basic developmental mechanisms are co-opted again for stress, injury and inflammatory responses by the myeloid hematopoietic system. Genetic analysis allows us to understand the interrelationship between these important biological phenomena that have great relevance to diseases and disorders in humans.
3. Metabolic control in Cancer pathways
In the past, our laboratory has identified components of signal transduction pathways that participate in oncogenesis (see Bonfini et al., Science, 1991; Flores et al., Cell 2000 for examples). We have also studied the role of the mitochondrion in controlling cell-cycle (Owusu-Ansah et al., Nature Genetics, 2008; Mandal et al., Dev. Cell, 2005). When cells become transformed, they choose alternate means of metabolism (a phenomenon referred to as the Warburg effect). We study the effect of signal transduction pathways on the control of cellular metabolism and the proper balance between cellular growth and metabolism that goes awry in Cancer.
4. Metabolic control of early mouse development
We also explore the control of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial activity and biogenesis during development using early mouse embryo and the embryonic stem cells derived from them as a model. There is relative lack of data on the mechanisms that control transition between various modes of metabolic activity during phases of development. Nuclear and mitochondrial activities constantly modulate each other, and the relationship between signal transduction pathways commonly studied during development, cancer and stem cell maintenance and metabolic pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, mitochondrial biosynthesis and nutrient sensing are being explored. Immediate projects include determining the metabolic processes that are essential for zygotic transcription, and the switch between mitochondrial and glycolytic processes during early mouse development.

The Braybrook Group at UCLA studies the generation of form in walled organisms.
In all organisms, the growing of a shape is a complex process requiring specific gene products, signalling, mechanical alterations, and coordination of cell growth. Our Team addresses this fundamental process in biology using a multidisciplinary approach including plant physiology, biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, materials science, and physics. We focus on understanding how shapes are generated in walled organisms: plants and algae.
For a plant and algal cells, the cell wall is the main structural element, controlling shape and growth of the cell and therefore tissue as a whole. Recent work has correlated key aspects of organ growth and shape generation, in plants, with mechanical properties of tissues and cell walls. Our Team has two main goals: 1) to understand the mechanics of shape growth in plants and algae, and 2) to understand the cell wall as a dynamic composite material.

The cardiovascular system is the first functioning organ during development. Abnormalities in the formation and/or function of the heart and vessels often lead to embryonic lethality or cause severe health issues in the adult. Our laboratory uses a multidisciplinary approach and the zebrafish model to understand the genetic, molecular and cellular basis of the cardiovascular system during normal development and in diseases.
Several unique features make zebrafish ideal for genetic and embryological studies. For instance, the transparent nature of zebrafish embryos provides easy access to observe and study organ development in live embryos. From classic and chemical genetic screens, we have identified mutations and compounds that affect proper patterning or function of the heart and vessels in the zebrafish. We are now using these mutants and compounds as points of entry to study questions about (1) molecular hierarchies important for the formation and cardiac progenitor cells; (2) molecular and cellular mechanisms for cardiac chamber maturation; (3) molecular and physiological mechanisms by which rhythmic cardiac contraction is maintained and by which cardiac arrhythmia occurs.

Our laboratory studies the molecular basis of the skeletal dysplasias, inherited human disorders that affect skeletal development, growth, and maintenance. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the genes and gene products that participate in the development of the skeleton and that ultimately determine the shapes of the bones, the height an individual achieves, and the stability of the skeleton. A major step toward achieving our goals is genomic analysis in skeletal dysplasia families to identify the gene associated with each of the over 450 different skeletal dysplasias. For disorders in which the defective gene is known, a combination of mutation analysis and biosynthetic studies is used to understand the mechanisms by which the mutations arise, the inheritance pattern of each disorder, and the effect of each mutation of the synthesis, structure, and function of the encoded protein. These goals are augmented by studies in model organisms, particularly mice, that include mechanistic studies and the development of therapies to ameliorate or cure these disorders.

Our overall goal is to understand the cell and molecular basis of germline cell differentiation and epigenetic reprogramming. My laboratory uses CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technologies, next generation sequencing, pluripotent stem cells and mouse modeling to achieve this goal. Results from our work will provide a biological understanding of the cell and molecular basis of human life and child health, and potentially the foundation for a cell based therapy to overcome human infertility.

Because uncontrolled cell division is so dangerous for an organism, cells must know not only when to divide, but?crucially?when not to. Cell division arrest prevents tumors and maintains the proper form of tissues. Many cells must also retain the ability to start dividing again when conditions are right, e.g., when the organism must grow, or a damaged tissue must be repaired. A cell in such a temporary, non-dividing state is said to be ?quiescent.? Quiescence is a common state for many somatic cells, including fibroblasts, lymphocytes, hematopoietic stem cells, and even dormant tumor cells. Failure to appropriately regulate the transition between quiescence and proliferation underlies several common and lethal disorders, including cancer and chronic wounds. My research is focused on understanding the molecular basis of quiescence using in vitro models, mouse models and human patients.

The heart is unable to regenerate heart muscle after a heart attack and lost cardiac muscle is replaced by scar tissue. Scar tissue does not contribute to cardiac contractile force and the remaining viable cardiac muscle is thus subject to a greater hemodynamic burden. Over time, the heart muscle eventually fails leading to the development of heart failure and 500,000 patients are diagnosed annually in the United States with heart failure. Thus the inability of the heart to regenerate cardiac muscle, coupled with a predominant fibrotic injury response remain major fundamental obstacles to treating heart disease.
Our laboratory studies the interface of cardiac fibroblasts (scar forming cells) and cardiac progenitors in determining how a cross talk between these cells regulates cardiac repair. We use murine models of cardiac injury and use a variety of fate mapping and conditional knockout strategies to alter specific genes at specific time points after injury to investigate our questions. We study the Wnt signaling pathway, a family of 19 closely related proteins that play key roles in organogenesis, wound healing and cancer. We have recently demonstrated that Wnt1, a Wnt known to play important roles in the development of the central nervous system plays an important role in regulating a fibrotic injury response in the heart. Using transgenic and conditional knock out strategies, we aim to alter the fibrotic repair response of the heart to enable regeneration.
Epicardium and mechanisms of EMT
The second area of investigation in our laboratory is to understand the role of cardiac cell plasticity and how plasticity can be modulated to affect wound healing in the adult heart. In this respect, we have recently shown that scar forming cells in the heart exhibit plasticity after cardiac injury and such plasticity can be modulated to affect the wound healing response (Nature 2014; 585-590). We study molecule mechanisms of such plasticity and aim to modulate the scar response by coaxing scar forming cells to adopt alternative cell fates. Another example of a plastic cardiac cell is the epicardial cell. The epicardium is a single layer of epithelial cells, that surrounds the heart. Although the epicardium is critically important for cardiac development, little is known about the function of the epicardium in the adult heart. We have recently demonstrated that the epicardium undergoes epithelial-mesenchymal-transition in a Wnt dependent manner after cardiac injury and generates cardiac fibroblasts that reside in the subepicardial space and contribute to cardiac fibrosis. The molecular regulation of epicardial EMT, identification of precursors in the epicardium that give rise to cardiac fibroblasts and its role in wound healing form another major focus in our laboratory.
Cardiac calcification
Calcification of the heart is a predominant phenotype of the aging heart and pathologic calcification predisposes to cardiac disease. For instance, calcification of the conduction system in humans causes slowing of conduction and heart blocks, while calcification of the valves leads to stiffening of the valve leaflets, and obstruction or regurgitation of blood across the valves secondary to defective coaptation of valve leaflets. The origins of the cells contributing to cardiac calcification and mechanisms regulating calcium deposition remain ill understood. Using human heart valves (obtained during surgical replacement of calcific heart valves), we isolate and study progenitor populations that can contribute to cardiac calcification. We also have murine models of calcification that we use to obtain fate maps about potential progenitor populations contributing to cardiac calcification and study mechanisms driving progenitors to adopt an osteoblast (calcium forming cell) fate. This project allows the interrogation of mechanisms in both murine models and human tissue.

During the next 50 years, we need to produce more food than in the entire history of humankind on a decreasing amount of land for crop production. A major challenge for the 21st century is to increase the yields of major crop plants, such as soybean, using state-of-the-art genetic technologies. One way to accomplish this task is to use genomics to understand all of the genes and genetic processes required to ?make a seed? in order to engineer plants for yield traits such as more seeds, bigger seeds, and seeds with improved nutritional composition. Increasing seed yield should contribute significantly to enhancing our food supply, because over half of the major crops used for human consumption are seed crops.
My laboratory has been investigating gene activity during seed development in order to identify the genes and gene regulatory networks required to program seed development. We have been carrying out experiments to 1) profile the mRNAs present in every soybean and Arabidopsis seed compartment (e.g., embryo, endosperm, seed coat), region (embryo proper, suspensor), and tissue (e.g., inner integument, endothelium, seed coat epidermis) throughout development, 2) characterize the epigenetic events at the DNA and chromatin level to understand their role in seed development, and 3) determine the targets of critical transcription factor genes programming seed development. The main focus of our experiments is to identify transcription factor genes that program differentiation events and determine how they form regulatory networks that program seed differentiation and function. The long-term goal of research being carried out in my laboratory is to understand ?how to make a seed? in order to use this information for the improvement of crop plants.

The research in the Goldstein laboratory is focused on the intersection between cancer biology, stem cell biology and metabolism. During his graduate work, Dr. Goldstein described the isolation of epithelial progenitor cells from mouse and human prostate tissue and demonstrated the capacity of progenitor cells to initiate prostate cancer in response to oncogenic transformation. Following up on this work, Dr. Goldstein and colleagues determined that prostate cancer can evolve from a basal cell of origin to a luminal-like tumor-propagating cell population. More recently, the Goldstein laboratory has been investigating the interplay between inflammation, epithelial progenitor cells, and tumorigenesis, using a combination of mouse and human tissue models. The main goals of the lab are to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms promoting epithelial cancer initiation, progression and resistance to treatment.

Brain function is based upon the precise connectivity of a large number of neurons. Connectivity in turn depends in large part on the genetically determined wiring properties of neurons, including their neurite projection, branching, and placement of synaptic contacts with specific partners. Research of my lab revolves around the question how gene expression controls neuronal connectivity and, thereby, brain function. We use the model system Drosophila, where virtually every gene can be targeted for knock-out or activation in a cell type selective manner Drosophila also offers the advantage that its brain is composed of a relatively small number of stereotyped neuronal lineages, groups of neurons descended from individual embryonic stem cells, called neuroblasts.
A longstanding line of research in our lab is to reconstruct how lineages assemble the major circuits of the fly brain. For the small larval brain, this reconstruction can now be done at a so far unparalleled level of resolution, using a series of several thousand contiguous electron microscopic sections in conjunction with a specially developed software package that allows us to assign all synapses to specific neurons and their lineages.
More recently, we have identified a specific circuit, called the anterior visual pathway (AVP), which conducts input form the eye to a brain center, the central complex, known to process and store visual information in order to control fly locomotion (walking, flight). The central part of this circuit is formed by three lineages, whose neurons form several classes of highly ordered parallel and sequential elements. We are investigating the function of the neuronal classes of the AVP, by recording their activity in response to defined visual stimuli, and follow the question of how the developmental history of a neuron (time of birth, placement within the spatial framework of the developing brain) relates to its later connectivity within the AVP circuit.
We conduct research contributing to our understanding of the genetic specification of brain circuitry. During the course of its proliferation, each neuroblast expresses characteristic sets of regulatory genes. These genes are assumed to be relevant in the control of the wiring properties of the neurons born from a particular neuroblast during a particular time interval. Our research aims to link the structurally defined lineages mapped in the larval brain with the neuroblasts of the embryo, using a technique that systematically labels all transcription factors expressed in neuroblasts and then follows the expression of these genes from neuroblast to lineage.
Finally, our work on the genetic patterning of the Drosophila brain guided us towards becoming more active in comparative studies, addressing questions of stem cells and neural development in other animal taxa. We decided to focus on several clades of basal metazoan, notably the flatworms (platyhelminthes) and acoels, generally considered to be the most primitive animals with a central nervous system, as well as cnidarians, which predate bilaterian animals.

Earlier, we studied the interaction between nitrogen-fixing bacteria (alpha-rhizobia) and legumes such as alfalfa, pea, and soybean to learn why this interaction occurs exclusively with legumes. The roots of legume plants house the bacteria, usually in root nodules, in which the microbes convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, thereby allowing the plant to live without added nitrogen fertilizer. In my early years at UCLA, I demonstrated the importance of phytohormones in nodule development, the significance of various plant and bacterial proteins for adherence to the root, and also showed the conservation of signal transduction pathways in nodulation and mycorrhization pathways based on common gene expression patterns.
Later, we began to investigate what-are-known as "non-traditional" nitrogen fixers, the newly discovered beta-rhizobia, as well as the plants associated with them. Because many of these bacteria exhibit metabolic activities, such as cellulose degradation as well as nodulation and nitrogen fixation (in the case of the beta-rhizobia), they have the potential, not only to be used for enhancing nitrogen nutrition in crop plants, especially as increased energy costs result in greater fertilizer expenditures, but also in the production of biofuels. To this end, I coordinated the sequencing and annotation of four Burkholderia genomes, including a species that nodulates agronomically important legumes growing in arid and acidic soils. In addition, two Micromonospora (actinobacteria) genomes were sequenced and these data are published. Micromonospora is an important Plant Growth Promoting Bacterial (PGPB) species. My lab has also determined that symbiotic Burkholderia spp. are unlikely pathogens based on bioinformatics analyses and by employing HeLa cell and Caenorhabditis elegans assays to determine non-pathogenicity. We recently published on the different arrangement of nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes in the plant-associated Burkholderia versus the well-studied alpha rhizobial species.
Because my research has always focused on the ?hidden half? of the plant, i.e. the root, and especially on the beneficial interactions that take place between plant roots and microbes in the rhizosphere microbiome, I made the transition early on to working on plant microbiomes. In so doing, we began to investigate a broader range of plant-growth promoting bacteria (PGPB), which are associated with roots, especially those isolated from arid environments. Our rationale is that as the climate changes, agricultural productivity will decline because crop-growing regions will become drier and less fertile. Novel drought-adapted, nitrogen-fixing bacteria are likely to provide genetic traits that increase both nutrient availability and environmental tolerance to salinity and drought brought about by reduced rainfall, higher soil acidity, and increased temperatures. In addition, many PGPB are effective at inhibiting plant pathogens, either directly by killing the pathogens or indirectly by making plants healthier so they can overcome pathogen infection. Moreover, a combination of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and one or more PGPB, such as Micromonospora or Bacillus spp., enhance plant growth and yield beyond single inoculation. The development of microbial consortia for plant inocula is the next direction of research that the Hirsch lab is pursuing. The microbes that inhabit nitrogen-fixing nodules grown in field conditions are the best way to determine which bacteria are compatible with another and could be used to establish consortia. My lab is also pursuing metagenomic and cultivation-dependent analysis of dryland soils as a means to find novel bacteria for inoculum development. We have licensed our discoveries from the Negev Desert (Israel) research, and we have a pending agreement with an agricultural company that is developing novel inocula to replace chemical amendments for certain crops. Studies in other deserts and dry environments are also in place.

Endothelial cells are unique in their ability to switch from a "differentiated" (non-dividing, non-invasive) to a relatively "undifferentiated" (invasive and highly mitotic) phenotype during the process of blood vessel formation or angiogenesis. We are intrigued by this plasticity and our research efforts are guided towards understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of endothelial gene expression. It is hoped that understanding the regulation of this switch will teach us lessons about differentiation pathways in general. Under this umbrella, the major focus of the laboratory has been the dissection of genetic programs involved in the formation and involution of blood vessels during development and in pathological conditions.
In the projects related to developmental angiogenesis, our models include the murine mammary gland and the chicken embryo. The mammary gland provides us with an excellent platform in which to study the expansion and regression of the vasculature associated with the physiological changes of this organ. The chicken embryo enables us to study the formation and remodeling of the vasculature during normal development. Using these two models we search for genes involved in vascular morphogenesis and ask funtional/mechanistic questions using genetics (transgenics and knock-outs in the case of the mouse) and molecular biology (transfection or chicken embryos using electroporation). By perturbing gene expression we hoped to further dissect the molecular pathways that guide vascular formation and remodeling.
A second focus of the lab has been to identify novel angiogenesis inhibitors. Evolution of several pathologies, including the growth of tumors, requires formation of new blood vessels. Blockade of these new blood vessels had been extremely effective in the restriction of tumor growth and suppression of metastasis. Therefore, the identification of novel, tumor-vascular specific, and non-toxic inhibitors has become a major focus of several academic and biotechnology groups. Using the anti-angiogenic region of thrombospondin-1 we have cloned and characterized two novel inhibitors METH-1 (also known as ADAMTS-1) and METH-2 (also known as ADAMTS-8). METH-1 and 2 are able to effectively suppress proliferation of new capillaries and in xenograph assays inhibit the growth of tumors. Both molecules are secreted matrix metalloproteases with disintegrin and thrombospondin motifs. We have invested a great effort in the full characterization and in understanding the mechanisms of action of these molecules. Projects include structure/function analysis of each of the domains: generation of transgenics and knock-ins, identification of substrates / natural inhibitors, and understanding regulation of gene expression.
The effect of steroid hormones, in particular progesterone, on vascular networks in vivo is another focus of the lab. We have found that progesterone inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and have remarkable effects in vascular permeability. Determination of the signaling pathways that result in these events and their biological relevance are major research efforts on this project.

Regulation of gene expression is crucial for every function carried out by the cell, from cell growth and proliferation to the ability of the cell to respond to its ever-changing environment. Hence, understanding cellular function and dysfunction is dependent upon deciphering these gene regulatory mechanisms. This is particularly challenging in the case of eukaryotic genes, which are often interrupted by long stretches of noncoding sequences (introns). These are removed from the newly synthesized RNA, and the remaining sequences (exons) are ligated together to form a mature messenger RNA. This process, pre-messenger RNA splicing, is carried out by the spliceosome made up of 5 small nuclear RNAs and over 100 proteins. Correct splicing is crucial to proper gene expression. In fact, it is estimated that over a quarter of all point mutations that lead to genetic disease are caused by defective splicing.
The spliceosome undergoes dynamic rearrangements in order to recognize splicing signals in the RNA and catalyze the splicing reaction. The goal of our research is to decipher the workings of this elegant ribonucleoprotein machine, which has become even more intriguing in light of evidence that splicing signals are recognized co-transcriptionally, while the RNA polymerase is still engaged with a chromatin template. Our work is focused on three key areas: (i) understanding the molecular details of the spliceosome rearrangements involved in splice site recognition and splicing catalysis; (ii) dissecting how this occurs in the context of transcription, chromatin modification, and other RNA processing events; and (iii) understanding how the cell exploits these mechanisms to respond to its environment.

Stem cells are the building blocks during development of organisms as varied as plants and humans. In addition, stem cells provide for the maintenance and regeneration of tissues, such as blood and skin, throughout the lifetime of an individual. The ability of stem cells to contribute to these processes depends on their ability to divide and generate both new stem cells (self-renewal) as well as specialized cell types (differentiation). The Jones lab uses the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian intestinal tissue as model systems to establish paradigms for how stem cell behavior is controlled.

Research Interests
We are interested in understanding a photosensory receptor called cryptochrome. Cryptochrome is a blue light receptor found in different organisms from a small weed Arabidopsis thaliana to a large animal Homo sapiens. Cryptochrome absorbs blue/UV-A light and it regulates various biological processes including biological clock in animals and flowering time in plants. We choose to work on an Arabidopsis cryptochrome, cry2 (cryptochrome 2), because Arabidopsis is relatively easy to work with. It is also a lot of fun to work with Arabidopsis because its genome has been completely sequenced so that we can use not only molecular genetics and biochemical techniques but also functional genomics approaches to solve our problems. We have found that cry2 regulates Arabidopsis flowering time, and we are trying to figure out how does cry2 do that (namely, what is the signal transduction mechanism of cry2)? We also try to understand how blue-light receptor cryptochromes work together with red-light receptor phytochromes in regulating cell elongation (namely, what is the co-action mechanism of different photoreceptors). You are welcome to come, discuss, or work on these challenge problems. You can also visit our homepage (

We use zebrafish to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which diverse and specialized cell types are developed during the vertebrate embryogenesis. Currently, our laboratory is particularly interested in three areas. First, we are working to define the genetic pathways underlying hematopoiesis and vasculargenesis. We are especially interested in identifying those factors that mediate the initial determination of hemangioblast and its subsequent differentiation into blood and vascular lineage-specific progenitor cells. Genetic, transgenic and microarray approaches have been used to identify and characterize these key factors. Secondly, we are studying the genetic basis underlying organ formation. The main focus of this research is to understand the genes and cells that direct pancreatic organogenesis. To this end, a number of zebrafish mutations affecting development of pancreas and endocrine beta cells have been isolated. There is a great need to be able to grow and develop pancreatic beta cells for treating diabetes by cell transplantation. This need challenges us to understand how a precursor cell gives rise to the pancreas and to characterize the gene products that specify cell fates during organogenesis. Finally, we are developing new technologies, such as genetic knockout and high throughput transgenesis, for zebrafish in order to better address fundamental questions raised in our biological studies. We have already developed a streamlined procedure of directly selecting multiple bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones based on public sequence database followed by rapid modification with GFP or RFP. BAC constructs offer greater fidelity in directing desirable expression of transgenes. Application of this technology in the transparent zebrafish embryos with the fluorescent protein reporter genes enables unparalleled visual analysis of gene expression in a living organism. A large-scale analysis of gene regulation using BAC transgenesis and comparative genomics approaches is currently ongoing in the laboratory. We plan to analyze hundreds of highly conserved developmental and disease genes from human, mouse, rat and zebrafish to reveal their common regulatory cis-acting elements and validate them in transgenic zebrafish. Given that developmental programs are well conserved among vertebrate animals, our studies in zebrafish should ultimately lead to a better understanding of the molecular and genetic basis underlying human development.

The Long laboratory is interested in the transcriptional networks that control polarity and stem cell formation during plant embryonic development. We have focused our research on the transcriptional co-repressor TOPLESS (TPL) that is involved in almost all aspects of plant development, and use a variety of approaches including genetics, genomics, biochemistry and confocal imaging in our research. Our work on TPL has uncovered multiple transcription factors involved not just in embryogenesis, but also in polarity decisions in the leaves, patterning of floral organs, and the response to the hormone auxin. We also study the chromatin modifying enzymes that TPL uses to repress transcription, which are conserved between plants and animals.

Elucidating the mechanisms of cell fate determination
Mammals have evolved a myriad of methods by which diverse tissues are specified, develop, and then are maintained by stem cells. Our lab is focused on the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie each of these processes to not only understand development, but also cancer, where these processes go awry. Our lab uses human pluripotent stem cells to model the acquisition of cell fate early in the embryo, and adult mice to model the de-differentiation that is the basis for cancer formation.

Members of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) subgroup of TGF�-related molecules have been implicated in many key signalling events in vertebrates and invertebrates. We are using the mouse as a model organism to study the roles of these regulatory factors during vertebrate development, focusing on skeletal tissues. Our approach is to take advantage of the genetic capabilities the mouse system offers, including transgenic and gene targeting technologies. We are also using organ and cell culture strategies.
We are also investigating the functions of the CCN family of matricellular proteins in various organs. We have generated gain and loss-of function models for 4 of the six family members and have identified essential functions in chondrogenesis, angiogenesis, and branching morphogenesis in the mammary and salivary glands. We have found that many of these effects appear to be mediated by the ability of CCN proteins to engage integrins.

Research Interests
Our lab is interested in the development of computational approaches to interpret genomic data. We seek to develop large-scale models of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation as well as signal transduction. Our approach is to build models that integrate varied data that sheds light on these phenomena. This data is produced using the latest generation of high throughput sequencers. Our research focuses on the development of both low and high-level analyses. For instance we are developing suites of tools for the analysis of high throughput sequencing data, including epigenomics and transcriptomics. Our goal is to make these tools, and the resulting databases, generally available to the scientific community.

Morphogenesis of sensory neurons and skin
Morphogenesis is the process by which cells adopt their specific shapes, sizes, and relationships with neighboring cells. Our lab studies the morphogenesis of developing skin cells and sensory neurons, which together mediate touch sensation. The skin at early developmental stages consists of two epithelial layers, each with distinct functions and morphologies. Sensory neurons project elaborately branched cellular processes called peripheral axons into the territory between the two skin layers to detect touch stimuli. We investigate how each of these cell types adopts its distinct morphological features and how skin cells and neurons influence each other?s morphogenesis.
To study these questions we use zebrafish embryos and larvae as a model. Because zebrafish eggs are externally fertilized and their embryos are optically clear, cellular behaviors can be imaged in live animals. Transgenic lines allow us to visualize specific cells and subcellular processes, laser-based techniques allow us to damage cells at precise times and places to study repair, and genetic manipulations provide insight into the molecular underpinnings of cellular behaviors. By studying basic cellular processes we hope to shed light on how they are impacted by damage and disease.

Research Interests
We want to understand the molecular biology of how Drosophila embryo cells collaborate to form a tissue. Basement membranes are fundamental to tissue construction. These thin nets of specialized, conserved extracellular proteins underlie epithelial cells and surround muscles and nerves. We have isolated, cloned and sequenced several of the component proteins, such as laminin and collagen, and are now studying mutant forms, the control of production, and interactions during development. Four new proteins are of special interest: Tiggrin, Peroxidasin, DUGT and Papilin.
Tiggrin is a 220kd connector protein at muscle attachment sites. One end of the protein binds to an integrin receptor in the muscle cell membrane. We are looking for Tiggrin?s molecular neighbor at the other end. Tiggrin also occurs elsewhere in embryos and is an excellent substrate for the differentiation of embryonic muscle cells in vitro, which we are studying.
Peroxidasin is the first combination of an enzyme and an extracellular matrix molecule. The cells which make this (170kd)3 trimer use its peroxidase activity during early embryogenesis to remove other cells that undergo programmed cell death. The secreted peroxidase becomes part of the matrix and probably stabilizes it by cross-linking. We are looking for mutants in Drosophila and for functions of peroxidasin in vertebrates.
DUGT is a universal editor/chaperone protein that we isolated and sequenced from Drosophila. This UDP-Glucose transferase distinguishes glycoproteins that are improperly folded and marks them by attaching a glucose residue. The glucose is the recognition signal for the malfolded proteins to interact with a chaperone system of the endoplasmic reticulum. By molecular manipulation we are investigating its key role as a chaperon/folding controller.
Papilin is a basement membrane protein vital during development.

Research Interests
Our lab is interested in Genomics, Bioinformatics, and Molecular Evolution. We want to understand the evolution of genomes, including the origin of eukaryotes and the origin of life, and want to relate their evolution to the molecular, cell and developmental events that have occurred. Five specific interests are described below.
Origin of the Multicellular Animals
For years scientists have wanted to know how the multicellular animals originated, but the morphological properties they had to work with were not particularly informative. With molecular sequences available, this has changed and we are obtaining sequences and starting to understand their evolution. We would particularly like to understand the separation of the deuterostomes (vertebrates, echinoderms, etc.) from the protostome (fruit flies, nematodes, etc.) groups and to relate it to the evolution of their genomes and developmental plans. (Nature, 1997).
Prokaryotic Ancestors of Eukaryotes
A fundamental challenge in biology is to discover the origins of the eukaryotic cell. We are searching for the immediate prokaryotic relatives of the eukaryotes. The strongest evidence to date is that eocyte prokaryotes (sulfur metabolizing, hyperthermophilic bacteria) are the immediate relatives of eukaryotes comes from the sequencing of elongation factor Tu genes in our lab (Science, 1992). Other recent evidence on the origin of eukaryotes from our lab have been the identification and characterization of an eukaryotic type I topoisomerase in a hyperthermophile, Methanopyrus, and the X-ray determination of a histone complex in Methanopyrus which has the structure of one-half of an eukaryotic nucleosome.
Genomic analyses
Analyses of complete genomes are providing unprecidented insights into the evolution of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. For example in a recent analyses of complete genomes (Rivera, et al., 1998; Jain, et al., 1999), we showed that both prokaryotes and eukaryotes contain two types of genes, and both types have different inheritances. One class of genes, informational genes (genes primarily involved in translation, transcription, replication, etc.), is a deeply diverging lineage which has been transferred in a tree-like pattern. In contrast, operational genes (genes primarily involved in housekeeping), have been inherited by horizontal transfer. These findings are rapidly changing our perceptions, of the evolution of life, and we are vigorously pursuing genome-level analyses
Computational Genomics
Our lab is also interested in the computational aspects of genomics. In addition to developing methods for studies of genome evolution, we are also developing tools for the identificaiton of genes within genomes. A particularily difficult problem is the determination of the locations of introns and exons within the human genome. Using novel, mathematically optimal algorithms, we are discovering new methods for analysis of the human genome and are deeply involved in the analysis of syntenic regions common to the human and mouse genomes.
Molecular Sequence Analysis
The computational analysis of gene evolution is still in it?s infancy and yet forms the technical basis for the field of molecular evolution. Our lab is currently working on three different aspects of sequence analysis: phylogeny reconstruction, sequence alignment, and the stochastic nature of sequence analysis. These areas are becoming increasingly important as we try to use sequences to probe deeper and deeper into the past.

The recent demonstration that eye tissue is formed after ectopic expression of the eyeless gene suggests that how tissues differentiate is driven by a limited number of "master" genes. Differentiated tissues are commonly formed through repetition of cell types. The model is that changing from one type to another is a consequence of overexpression of the "master" gene inhibiting another.. The ability of any gene to have this effect is the basis for an overexpression screen to select such key genes. Such a screen is now underway in my lab through bringing a mobile copy of the yeast enhancer element that binds the transcription factor Gal4 to lie adjacent to previously unknown genes. Activation of the enhancer through Gal4 expression will be recognized through changes in cellular differentiation if the enhancer is adjacent to a key gene. In particular, cells in the wing margin differentiate into three kinds of sensory bristles plus trichome-bearing cell. I am interested in finding the genes that determine these choices and their pattern in the margin, through overexpression changes in phenotype. Molecular genetic analysis will be used to identify their normal roles in development.

Dr. Gallagher is broadly trained in moral and political philosophy, and specializes in problems at the intersection of ethics, theories of justice, and science.  Her applied research interests focus on the ethical and public policy implications of scientific and technological innovation – in particular, on recent advances in the biomedical sciences and computing.  She also works, in a less applied fashion, on a number of topics in the philosophy of science whose conceptual analysis matters to normative theory – including chance, causation, and cognition.  She received her A.B. from Harvard University, and her Ph.D. from Princeton University, where her dissertation research was on the ethics of risk imposition and distribution.  She has held previous academic appointments at Princeton, Harvard, MIT, CSUN, and USC.  At UCLA, she teaches MCDB 60: Biomedical Ethics, and Philosophy 6: Introduction to Political Philosophy.
Selected Publications
Ongoing and current projects include work on the relationship between risk imposition and legitimizing consent in clinical research; the moral status of novel research subjects in stem cell biology; theoretical foundations of “ethical AI;” and counterfactual analyses of harm.

My primary area of research was at the axis of neurodegeneration, inflammation, and stem cell biology. My work focused on identification of repair mechanisms of cell replacement strategies for the treatment of spinal cord injuries (SCI).
My experience in the field of SCI was over a decade long. During this period, I worked closely with Dr. Aileen Anderson and was involved in planning and execution of many studies investigating the role of the microenvironment on stem cell fate and migration properties. I worked with multiple animal models of SCI as well as in vitro studies involving human neural stem cells.
For my dissertation and beyond, I identified key components of the peripheral immune system in modulating human neural stem cell properties. When I first began these studies, there were only a handful of papers addressing the role of the inflammatory cascade on stem cells. My studies triggered much of our current understanding in this area. We have identified the both cellular and humoral innate immune response candidates in directing stem cell fate and migration both in vitro and in vivo.
As well, some of my data using stem cells in a cervical model of SCI was used as the basic science evidence for the initiation of a Phase I/II FDA-approved clinical trial investigating the role of human neural stem cell transplantation after cervical SCI in humans.

I teach MCDB 104AL, a discovery based laboratory course on developmental biology. In the class we use the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, as the model organism. During the quarter, students will attempt to clone and study the expression patterns of genes involved in sea urchin embryogenesis. In addition to MCDB 104AL, I also teach MCDB 138, MCDB 141 and MCDB 191.
