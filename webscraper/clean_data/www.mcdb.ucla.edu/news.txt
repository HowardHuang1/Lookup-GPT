George G. & Betsy H. Laties Graduate Fellowship
November 13, 2023
Congratulations!
Melissa Kosty and Tyler Buckley were selected by the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology to receive the George G. & Betsy H. Laties Graduate Fellowship. They were each awarded a fellowship of $40,000 this academic year. The fellowship supports eligible Graduate Programs in Bioscience students in their second or third year of study who specialize in molecular plant biology.
Melissa is a second-year graduate student in the Cell and Developmental Biology home area of the Molecular Biology PhD program. The George G. & Betsy H. Laties Graduate Fellowship will support her research project identifying new proteins involved in the development of the plant shoot apical meristem, which contains the stem cells responsible for the production of all above-ground organs throughout the life of the plant. This support will additionally allow her to mentor undergraduate researchers to assist with key parts of this project.
Tyler Buckley is recognized for his work on unraveling gene silencing through DNA methylation, particularly focusing on Methyl-CpG-Binding Domain proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. The George G. & Betsy H. Laties Graduate Fellowship empowers Tyler to delve deeper into his research, aiming to uncover the intricate mechanisms of gene silencing. Beyond research, Tyler sees the fellowship as a career milestone, providing opportunities to mentor future scientists and contribute to advanced courses at UCLA. The financial support enhances his ability to guide undergraduates in the Jacobsen laboratory, fostering a passion for scientific discovery and making science more inclusive.
