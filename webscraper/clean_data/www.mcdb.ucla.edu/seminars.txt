"Diversity in Our STEM Ranks: Describing Data, Finding Hope and Seeing Change"
This seminar addresses published literature on racial representation in STEM faculty, data on inequities in NIH research grant award rates and data on racial disparities in STEM graduate student progress. We will report our data on the impact of having open and honest conversations with undergraduates about inequities in STEM, assessed as part of our Biomedical Research 1A: Science in Your Time course. From this talk, new perspectives will be gained on the extent of racial disparities that exist in STEM at all levels. More importantly, we hope that the data will help develop personal strategies for creating a more inclusive environment for students and colleagues. Ultimately, our goal is to describe the status of racial disparities in STEM in the US and find the principles of progress as a community of scientists.

"MBI Thursday Research Seminar | Melina Schuh, Ph.D. | Hosted by Margot Quinlan"
Abstract: The Schuh lab studies meiosis in mammalian oocytes. In her presentation, Melina will summarize her lab’s recent research on the spindle in mammalian oocytes. Her lab found that human oocyte spindles are surprisingly unstable, and identified functions for actin and a liquid-like meiotic spindle domain for spindle assembly in mammalian oocytes.
In the main part of her talk, she will present recent work from her lab that sheds light on the origin of high aneuploidy rates in mammalian embryos. The vast majority of human embryos are aneuploid. Aneuploidy frequently arises during the early mitotic divisions of the embryo, but the origin of this remains elusive. Using bovine embryos as a model for human embryos, we identify an error-prone mechanism of parental genome unification which often results in aneuploidy. Surprisingly, genome unification initiates hours before breakdown of the two pronuclei that encapsulate the parental genomes. While still within intact pronuclei, the parental genomes polarize towards each other, in a process driven by centrosomes, dynein, and microtubules. The maternal and paternal chromosomes eventually cluster at the pronuclear interface, in direct proximity to each other. Parental genome clustering often fails however, leading to severe chromosome segregation errors, incompatible with healthy embryo development. Nucleoli, which associate with chromatin, also cluster at the pronuclear interface in human zygotes. Defects in nucleolar clustering correlate with failure in human embryo development, suggesting a conserved mechanism.

"How to make microtubules and build the cytoskeleton"
Abstract:
How does a cell construct its microtubule cytoskeleton? According to Feynman’s principle “what I cannot create, I do not understand”, my lab pursues this question by building the chromosome segregation machinery from scratch. I will first tell you how the microtubule framework is generated in a cell. Upon deciphering the function of the most important microtubule accessory proteins, I will present how we use those building blocks to reconstitute a spindle substructure in vitro and determine its building plan. Finally, I will outline how we combine spindle substructures like pieces of a puzzle to assemble and thereby understand a functioning spindle that segregates chromosomes.
By studying how the MT cytoskeleton is built, I hope to help explain how hundreds of proteins can self-assemble on the nm scale into a complex molecular machine 1000-fold larger than its constituents, a challenge for the biochemistry of the 21st century

Title: RNA dynamics of viral capsids
Abstract
Understanding the dynamics of biomolecules in solution is challenging, and to do so in the cellular environment is even more difficult. To get a grasp on how dynamic long RNAs are in cells, cell-free/in vitro systems currently offer ideal systems which can reveal biophysical properties of RNA that may contribute to their biological function.
To study such dynamics, I will discuss studies conducted with an RNA plant virus, brome mosaic virus, which is a model system for understanding dynamic processes like viral capsid self-assembly and disassembly. We characterize the structure and dynamics of the RNA inside and outside the symmetric protein capsid shell and how they may lead to a novel mechanism for viral RNA release and delivery to the host cellular machinery. I will discuss some biophysical approaches we have taken to capture the dynamics of these capsids and how these dynamics play a role in optimizing RNA genome release from viruses.

Title: Unraveling Notch signaling mechanisms controlling crystal cell development.
Abstract
Crystal cells play important roles in antimicrobial immune response and clot formation in Drosophila. Using a combination of transcriptomics and genetic dissection, we have revealed new molecular and cellular mechanisms that control Notch signaling during crystal cell development. These include regulation at the level of RNA, protein, and intracellular localization that ultimately results in a switch between canonical and non-canonical Notch signaling.

"Light at the End of SARS-CoV-2: Integrating 4-D Light-Sheet and Light-Field to Elucidate Cardiac Morphogenesis"
Abstract:
During cardiac development, peristaltic contraction of the embryonic heart tube produces time-varying hemodynamic forces and pressure gradients across the atrioventricular canal. However, the relative importance of myocardial contraction and hemodynamic force to modulate cardiac morphogenesis remain poorly understood.  By using dual illumination and dual detection light-sheet system, we recapitulate flow-mediated Notch1b-Nrg1-ErbB2 signaling underlying the initiation of endocardial trabeculation for contractile function. We demonstrate myocardial contractile force-mediated Notch1b-endothealial mesenchymal transition underlying valvulogenesis in the ventricular outflow tract. Overall, we integrate advanced optics with zebrafish genetics to provide biomechanical insights into cardiac development with translational implications for congenital heart disease.

"Genomic Imbalance and 3D-Genome Organization in Intellectual Disability"
Abstract:
Genomic imbalances, including aneuploidies and copy number variants (CNVs), are one of the leading causes of intellectual disabilities such as Down syndrome (DS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Rare mutations that disrupt the 3D-genome organization have also been associated with intellectual disability. While these disorders display similar clinical features, the molecular mechanisms underlying this convergence remains unclear. We find that neural progenitors harboring trisomy 21, an aneuploidy that leads to DS, exhibit global 3D-genome reorganization, disruption of the nuclear lamina, and genome-wide chromatin accessibility changes. These features resemble the genome-wide transcriptional and nuclear-architecture changes that are characteristic of senescent cells. Moreover, we find that an ASD-associated mutation in CTCF induces a transcriptional profile similar to those observed in neural progenitors derived from individuals with DS, indicating that there is a molecular mechanism convergence between aneuploidies and chromosomal looping disruptions. Additionally, we find that treatment of neural progenitors harboring trisomy 21 with anti-senescence drugs (senolytics) alleviates the transcriptional and cellular changes associated with the neurodevelopmental malformations observed in individuals with DS. Our findings indicate that senescence plays a key role in the neurodevelopmental pathogenesis of DS and pharmacologically targeting senescence may provide a novel therapeutic avenue for treating individuals with DS.

"Uncovering new functions of RNA modifications in mRNA processing"
Abstract:
Emerging evidence indicates that eukaryotic messenger RNAs are extensively decorated with modified nucleosides that have the potential to regulate eukaryotic gene expression through effects on mRNA metabolism. This talk will describe the discovery that the RNA modification pseudouridine is installed co-transcriptionally to pre-mRNA at thousands of positions by multiple pseudouridine synthases, revealing an endogenous function of pre-mRNA pseudouridylation in pre-mRNA processing. This function of pseudouridine synthases is important for our understanding of the many diseases associated with human pseudouridine synthase dysregulation.

"Gamete Generation from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells: How Close Are We to Creating Sperm and Eggs in the Lab?"
Harvard Stem Cell Institute
Monthly Consortia Series
Presenter: Amander Clark, PhD
Infertility is a disease that affects millions of reproductive age men, women, and non-binary persons in the U.S. For persons who want a biologically related child, one of the most common treatments involves invitro fertilization (IVF). However, IVF is not an option for persons who no longer make gametes. Instead, a new experimental procedure known as in vitro gametogenesis (IVG) could be used in these cases.
IVG involves making gametes outside of the body either from stalled gamete precursor cells, or from skin cells that can be turned into egg or sperm cells in the laboratory. Animal models have successfully used IVG to restore fertility, and basic science research is currently translating this technology to human cells - with particular emphasis on reprogramming skin cells into stem cells, followed by IVG into gametes. Amander Clark and Insoo Hyun will consider the scientific, ethical, and policy issues related to IVG as a next generation approach for human reproduction.

"Symmetry breaking during morphogenesis of a mechanosensory organ"
Abstract:
The development of mechanosensory epithelia, such as those of the auditory and vestibular systems, results in the precise orientation of mechanosensory hair cells and consequently directional sensitivity. After division of a precursor cell in the zebrafish lateral line, the daughter hair cells differentiate with opposite mechanical sensitivity. This process produces neuromasts containing equal numbers of hair cells of two opposite polarities, half of them sensitive to caudad water movement and half to rostrad flow.
Using a combination of experimental tools and mathematical modeling we show how Notch-mediated lateral inhibition produces a bistable switch that reliably gives rise to hair-cell pairs of opposite polarity. This spontaneous symmetry breaking drives polarity-dependent movements of hair cells that lead to the establishment of a mirror-symmetric organization of the organ. We model these reconfigurations by describing the effective surface tensions of the hair cells and the changes in these quantities throughout the developmental process. These results provide a unified experimental and theoretical framework to describe the polarity selection and directed migration of hair cells in the zebrafish lateral line.

"Biologist, Know Thy Cells - A Colorful Barcoding Method to ID Cell Types, their Fate, and Decode Brainwide Communication"
Abstract:
A major challenge in biological imaging is resolving cell identities. These are necessary for determining cell-specific protein expression and function, the effect of transcription factors on cell fate, and the contribution of individual neurons to brainwide activity and behavior. Present methods are limited to a piecemeal approach, using multiple strains to identify a few cell types at a time. I introduce a new method and software that can identify many cell types, and in some cases all neurons, in vivo using a single strain. My method combines cell reporters with five distinguishable fluorescent proteins to create unique, stereotyped color codes that identify cell types. I illustrate this in C. elegans, engineering a multicolor transgene called NeuroPAL (a Neuronal Polychromatic Atlas of Landmarks), to create an identical colormap in all worms that uniquely identifies every neuron, showcasing three applications. First, I identify the neuronal expression patterns of all metabotropic receptors for acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate, thus completing a map of this communication network. My findings indicate that second-messenger systems are the primary means of GABA communication in worm, and further suggest widespread extrasynaptic GABA signaling. Second, I analyze the conserved transcription factor EOR-1/PLZF and, despite its ubiquitous expression, uncover a precise role in neuronal fate. Third, I identify brainwide codes for gustatory and olfactory stimuli. My findings show a complex code that challenges the present view that global neuronal activity is simply low dimensional. To facilitate the workflow, I present semi-automated cell identification software and optimal-coloring software to apply the same method in other tissues and organisms. Lastly, I discuss future applications: investigating how whole-nervous-system activity is remodeled to change behavior during early development, sexual maturation, in response to environmental stress, and even across 15+ million years of evolutionary divergence.

"Single Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics Defines the Cellular Architecture of the Antimicrobial Response Network in Human Leprosy Granulomas."
Abstract
Granulomas are complex cellular structures comprised predominantly of macrophages and lymphocytes that function to contain and kill invading pathogens. Here, we investigated single cell phenotypes associated with antimicrobial responses in human leprosy granulomas by applying single cell and spatial sequencing to leprosy biopsy specimens. We focused on reversal reactions (RR), a dynamic process in which some patients with disseminated lepromatous leprosy (L-lep) transition towards self-limiting tuberculoid leprosy (T-lep), mounting effective antimicrobial responses. We identified a set of genes encoding proteins involved in antimicrobial responses that are differentially expressed in RR versus L-lep lesions, and regulated by IFN-g and IL-1b. By integrating the spatial coordinates of the key cell types and antimicrobial gene expression in RR and T-lep lesions, we constructed a map revealing the organized architecture of granulomas depicting compositional and functional layers by which macrophages, T cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts contribute to the antimicrobial response.

"Arabidopsis MORC proteins function in the establishment of RNA directed DNA methylation"
Abstract
The Microrchidia (MORC) family of ATPases are required for transposable element (TE) silencing and condensation of heterochromatin in both plants and animals, and C. elegans MORC-1 has been shown to topologically entrap and condense DNA. In Arabidopsis thaliana, mutation of MORCs has been shown to reactivate silent methylated genes and transposons and to decondense heterochromatic chromocenters, despite only minor changes in the maintenance of DNA methylation. Here we provide the first evidence localizing MORC proteins to specific regions of chromatin and find that MORC4 and MORC7 are closely co-localized with sites of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). We further show that MORC7, when tethered to DNA by a specific zinc finger can facilitate the establishment of RdDM. Finally, we show that MORCs are required for the efficient establishment of de novo RdDM when plants are transformed with an FWA transgene, even though morc mutations have no effect on the maintenance of preexisting methylation at FWA. We propose that MORCs act as de novo silencing factors in RdDM complexes by tethering these complexes to DNA to facilitate methylation establishment. These findings have implications for MORC protein function in a variety of other eukaryotic organisms.

"From one cell to many: Deciphering regulation in mammalian development"
Ontogeny describes the emergence of complex multicellular organisms from single totipotent cells. In mammals, this field is particularly challenging due to the indeterminate relationship between self-renewal and differentiation, variation of progenitor field sizes, and internal gestation. Here, we present a flexible, high information, multi-channel molecular recorder with a single cell (sc) readout and apply it as an evolving lineage tracer to define a mouse cell fate map from fertilization through gastrulation. By combining lineage information with scRNA-seq profiles, we recapitulate canonical developmental relationships between different tissue types and reveal the nearly complete transcriptional convergence of endodermal cells from extra-embryonic and embryonic origins.  Finally, we apply our cell fate map to estimate the number of embryonic progenitor cells and their degree of asymmetric partitioning during specification.  Our approach enables massively parallel, high-resolution recording of lineage and other information in mammalian systems to facilitate a quantitative framework for understanding developmental processes.

"Characterization of lineage decisions in developmental trajectories using single-cell data"
How a cell decides its lineage is a long-standing and enigmatic question in molecular biology. I will present my research to characterize lineage decisions in developmental trajectories by computational modeling of high throughput data such as single-cell RNA-seq. I will describe Palantir, the first single-cell trajectory detection algorithm to model continuities in lineage decisions. Palantir models differentiation as a Markov process to compute the lineage biases and differentiation potential, a measure of plasticity, for all cells. Palantir modeling enables an accurate identification of lineage decision regions and associated gene expression and regulatory dynamics. I will then describe our study to characterize the spatial and temporal trajectories of mouse endoderm development. Combining Palantir modeling with a large-scale single-cell data, we uncovered an unexpected plasticity of embryonic epiblast cells to differentiate to the surrounding extra-embryonic endoderm at implantation and the concomitant emergence of the spatial signal in the endoderm. Our analysis further demonstrated the convergence of embryonic definitive and extra-embryonic visceral endoderm cells into spatially organized organ territories in the gut-tube at mid-gestation.

"The Connections Between Enhancer Architecture and Function"
To carry out an enormous diversity of tasks, proteins can assume a variety of structures or disordered states, and years of work have made the connection between protein sequences, structures, and functions. Enhancers and other pieces of regulatory DNA regulate gene expression in highly disparate biological processes, but we still lack general principles that can help us connect enhancer sequence, transcription factor binding site arrangement (or architecture), and function. In my seminar, I will share two projects that seek to make connections between the way enhancers are built and the tasks they carry out in two biological settings: early development and the innate immune response in Drosophila. In the first part, I will describe a mechanism by which redundant (shadow) enhancers control expression noise, and in the second, I will describe the patterns of evolution that drive divergence in the expression response to bacterial infection.

"Adaptive Optics Lattice Light-Sheet Imaging and AI Powered Big Data Processing of Live Stem Cell-Derived Organoids"
New methods in stem cell 3D organoid tissue culture, advanced imaging, and big data image analytics now allow tissue-scale 4D cell biology but currently available analytical pipelines are inadequate for handing and analyzing the resulting gigabytes and terabytes of high-content imaging data. We expressed fluorescent protein fusions of clathrin and dynamin2 at endogenous levels in genome- edited human embryonic stem cells, which were differentiated into intestinal epithelial organoids. Lattice light-sheet imaging with adaptive optics (AO-LLSM) allowed us to image large volumes of these organoids (70 × 60 × 40 μm xyz) at 5.7 s/frame. We developed an open-source data analysis package termed pyLattice to process the resulting large (∼60 Gb) movie data sets and to track clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) events. We then expressed fluorescent protein fusions of actin and tubulin in genome-edited induced human pluripotent stem cells, which were differentiated into human cortical organoids. Using the AO-LLSM mode on the new MOSAIC (Multimodal Optical Scope with Adaptive Imaging Correction) allowed us to image neuronal migration deep in the organoid. We augmented pyLattice with a deep learning module and used it to process the brain organoid data.
