Undergraduate
The Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology major provides undergraduate students with cutting-edge information on the molecular process involved in cell function and differentiation. The curriculum consists of several core and elective disciplines that are updated yearly to reflect advances in the field.  Most of the upper division courses integrate recent scientific articles and enable students to experience how new information is scrutinized and validated by the scientific community.
In addition, students in MCDB or any other UCLA major may apply for the
Biomedical Research Minor
.  This minor was developed by MCDB faculty to fill a gap in biotechnology education.  The minor curriculum includes four quarters of hands-on research experience in addition to five core courses aimed at supporting and enhancing the research activities.  The Biomedical Research Minor curriculum coordinates very well with the requirements for the MCDB major, which may include up to three quarters of hands-on research experience.
Students in the MCDB major and the Biomedical Research Minor develop powerful analytical skills and a sophisticated expertise in the life sciences, which makes them highly valued in diverse vocations such as scientific research, scientific writing, teaching, consulting, biotechnology, government, and the health professions.
