PANDA: Welcome
Peer
Agent Negotiation and Deployment of Adapters
Welcome to the
Panda
project.
Panda
(Peer Agent Negotiation and Deployment of Adapters) was a multi-year
DARPA-funded
research effort  (June 98 to July 02) undertaken by the Laboratory
for
Advanced Systems Research
(LASR)
(formerly the
File Mobility Group
)
in UCLA's
Computer Science Department
.
Panda
is a middleware support system
for
active networks that allows both aware and unaware applications to
benefit
from the superior adaptability and performance of active networks. It
performs
planning and negotiation of active network agent deployment, adapts to
failures and other major changes in network characteristics, and
handles
automatic deployment of agent code to active network nodes.
Panda
is built on the base of an
existing
adaptive-agent framework developed at UCLA under our DARPA-funded
Travler
contract. An existing active network execution environment called ANTS
was
used
as the platform for the middleware services that
Panda
provides.
In December of
2000, the value
of
Panda
was successfully demonstrated at the Active Networks
PI
meeting in Atlanta, Georgia
.
A pair of network video
and audio streams were
intercepted
from legacy applications (which were unaware of the the active networks
environment) and redirected through a series of related active networks
software packages. We were able to selectively prioritize one pair of
streams
based on a determination of who the speaker was.
