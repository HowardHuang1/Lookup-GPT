Travler: Welcome
Welcome to the LASR Lab's
Travler
project pages
(note
that this link provides a more detailed discussion of the
Travler
project, including links to related research, important papers and
software downloads).
The

(
Travler
) project was one of several multi-year DARPA-funded
research efforts (1994-1999) within the UCLA Computer Science
Department. This nomadic computing project focused on developing
models, prototyping systems software and conducting experiments to
support the needs of not just multiple users using the same files and
systems, but users that are increasingly mobile.
The illustration above depicts deployment of the various
Travler
project components. Some of the call-outs will link you to a page
describing that component in detail. Although this illustration depicts
Travler
within the dynamics of a military environment,
Travler
is equally valuable in any conceivable mobile computing environment.
Each principal investigator on the
Travler
project had
an extensive background in a project-essential nomadic computing field:
Leonard
Kleinrock
is recognized as one of the leading experts on
modeling of computer networks. Because of his pioneering work on the
first ARPANET protocols, he has been acknowledged as one of the
"fathers" of the Internet.
Gerald
Popek
has been developing system software for distributed
environments and researching security for system software for over
twenty years.
Rajive
Bagrodia
is a leading expert in the field of parallel discrete event simulation
and has taken the lead in designing simulation platforms to support
research in mobile computing.
Peter
Reiher
has been developing system software for unreliable
distributed environments for fifteen years, including naming systems,
replicated file systems, and systems for secure collaboration over
insecure networks.
