DDoS Network Attack
Recognition and Defense
Project
Description
Today's routers offer
a best-effort service: they forward all traffic toward
destinations, attempting to deliver fast and fair service to all flows.
Policing, reliability, and rate-control mechanisms are therefore left
to
be deployed by higher layers at end hosts. This feature has been
misused
in distributed denial-of-service attacks, where many compromised hosts
simultaneously generate excessive traffic to a victim. The number of
received
packets overwhelms the target, consuming its resources and rendering
its
services unavailable. Many attempts have been made to design systems
that
help identify attacking machines and stop malicious flows. Most of
these
systems are located on the target side (either at the victim host or
somewhere
in the target network), which facilitates easy detection of the problem
and possible characterization of the attack signature. However, they
are
ineffective in stopping the attack because they require the cooperation
of upstream routers to push back the attacking flows.  Other
proposed
systems are located in the network between the attacking machines and
the
victim. These identify and throttle attacking flows, autonomously or
acting
on a signal from the victim. They require significant changes in core
routers
and still do not prevent malicious flows from using network resources.
We
propose a system that is located at the source network router (either
LAN or border router) that autonomously detects and suppresses DDoS
flows
originating at this network. This system observes the outgoing and
incoming
traffic and gathers lightweight statistics on the flows, classified by
destination. These statistics, along with built-in traffic models,
define
legitimate traffic patterns. Any discrepancy between observed traffic
and
a legitimate traffic pattern for a given destination is considered to
be
the signal of a potential DDoS attack. The source router then decides
to
throttle all traffic to the suspected target of the attack and at the
same
time attempts to separate attacking flows from legitimate flows and
identify
the attacking machines. This approach has the benefit of preventing
malicious
flows from entering the network and consuming resources. As the part of
our future work, we will investigate the possibility of also deploying
this system on the core routers.
D-WARD
was funded under DARPA contract N66001-01-1-8937. Additionlly, thanks
to a funds and
equipment grant from the
Intel
Corporation
, we had an opportunity to use Intel's IXP equipment to
combat DDoS attacks in routers close to attack sources.
