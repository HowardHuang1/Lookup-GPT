Summary
In today's
Internet any node can send a packet to any other node that uses the
standard protocol set. When abused by attackers, such flexibility can
also lead to various kinds of disastrous behaviors at the target. The
SYN denial-of-service attack is one example. While developing more
robust protocol behaviors is important, complex protocols are unlikely
to be completely bullet-proof. One good method of foiling such attacks
is to identify the culprit and take measures to stop him, such as
shutting off his node from the network, contacting his system
administrator, or notifying law enforcement authorities.
These methods
only work if the attacker can almost always be correctly identified.
Unfortunately, in today's Internet one cannot easily identify attackers
with any confidence. The obvious way to determine the sender of a
malicious packet is to examine the source address field in the IP
header; but existing Internet protocols allow senders to fill in this
field arbitrarily. Despite incorrect source address fields, the network
will properly route the packet to its destination. Responses, of
course, will go to someone other than the attacker, which means that
this vulnerability most likely cannot be used to obtain secret
information or services. On the other hand, sometimes this feature
allows the attacker to assault two sites for the price of one, since
any bad responses to the packet will be routed to the misidentified
sender, possibly causing further difficulties there. The receiver of
the malicious packet has no confidence that the source address field is
accurate.
Researchers in
the Laboratory for Advanced Systems Research (
LASR
)
in UCLA's Computer Science Department have worked on an address
filtering project to solve this problem. Thanks to a funds and
equipment grant from the
Intel
Corporation
, we were given an opportunity to study the feasibility
of putting important security enhancements into high-speed routers. In
the SAVE project, we used Intel's IXP equipment to develop a system
capable of filtering out packets with forged IP source addresses.
