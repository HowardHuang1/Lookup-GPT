Peter L. Reiher
Dr. Peter Reiher is an adjunct professor in the
Computer
                    Science Department
at UCLA and heads up the
Laboratory for Advanced
                    Systems
                    Research
(LASR)
. His research
                  interests include distributed operating systems,
                  active networks,
                  computer
                  security, the use of optimistic methods in computing,
                  and parallel
                  discrete
                  event simulation.
The
Laboratory
                      for Advanced Systems
                      Research
conducts
                    important research in many areas related to
                    networks, operating
                    systems,
                    and distributed system.  Peter has been a
                    principal investigator
                    (PI)
                    or co-principal investigator on numerous on-going
                    and recently
                    completed
research
                      efforts
funded by
                    NSF, DARPA, Intel, Microsoft, HP and GTE.
Prior
                    to joining the
LASR
                      Group
(formerly the
File
                      Mobility
                      Group
) at UCLA, Peter contributed to
                    important projects at
JPL
,
                    including
                    the Time Warp Operating System, a project
                    experimenting with optimistic
                    synchronization mechanisms for parallel processing.
                    As the chief
                    designer
                    for this system, he was the co-recipient of a 1990
                    R&D 100 Award
                    which
                    targets the 100 best research and development
                    projects of the year.
Peter received his B.S. in electrical
                    engineering
                    from the University of Notre Dame in 1979, and his
                    M.S. and Ph.D. in
                    computer science from UCLA in 1983 and 1987.
Peter teaches graduate courses in the
                    UCLA Computer
                    Science Department on advanced operating
                    systems,
                    distributed
                    operating systems, computer security, and
                    experimental methodology for
                    system software.
