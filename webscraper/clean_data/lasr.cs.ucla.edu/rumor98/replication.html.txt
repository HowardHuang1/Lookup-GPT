Rumor: Replication for Mobile Computers
RUMOR
Replication for Mobile
Computers
The
Travler
project
developed several mobile data replication services.
The most mature of these was
Rumor
.
Rumor is a file replication system that can be
used to
keep multiple copies of files consistent. Rumor is especially useful
for
keeping replicated files on mobile computers. Maintaining multiple
replicas
of each file allows for higher availability. In particular, allowing
mobile
computers to store file replicas ensures that users will be able to
access
important data while disconnected, while still maintaining a single
environment
shared with workstation machines when connected. To further improve
availability,
Rumor uses an optimistic replication strategy. Optimistic replication
permits
any accessible replica to be updated, thus allowing disconnected
portable
computers to not only read, but also write, their local file
replicas.
Rumor is a portable optimistic replicated file
service
built as a wrapper around an existing file system. A Linux version of
Rumor
is up and running, with a
beta
release
available on the web.
Rumor
portability
is achieved by dividing the system's functionality into
a larger system independent replication service and a smaller system
dependent
service.
Rumor uses important algorithms and data
structures originally
built for
Ficus
. Ficus is
a
successful in-kernel replication service based on SunOS 4.1.1.
Since Rumor is a user-level system, it can be
installed
and maintained by normal users. No root privileges are required.
Rumor's optimistic replication strategy will
permit concurrent
updates which can lead to inconsistent replicas of a single file. Rumor
detects such inconsistencies and applies automated mechanisms to
resolve
them.
We are currently working on other replication
solutions
to mobile computing problems, including a file hoarding service for
portable
computers (
Seer
)
and a file replication service capable of supporting hundreds of
writable
replicas.
The primary Rumor paper
was
presented
at the ER'98 Workshop on Mobile Data Access.
A position paper
on Rumor
was presented in the SIGCOMM Workshop on Middleware.
