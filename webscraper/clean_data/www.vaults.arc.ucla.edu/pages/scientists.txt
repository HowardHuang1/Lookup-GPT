Frequently Asked Questions
Vaults
are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles found in nearly all eukaryotic cells. They were first described in 1986. Because the particle is abundant in all cells of higher eukaryotics and highly conserved throughout evolution, it is likely that vaults have an important cellular function.
