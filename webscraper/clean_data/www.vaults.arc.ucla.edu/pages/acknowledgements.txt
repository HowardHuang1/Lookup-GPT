Welcome to the Vault Website: Maintained by the Rome Laboratory at UCLA: OPEN_CMS
Vault research at UCLA has been possible because of the generous support of a number of organizations and foundations. By far the largest contributor has been the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Specifically the Institute of General Medical Sciences which funded a vault function RO1 grant to LHR from 1986 (with the exception of a couple rocky competitive renewals) until 2002. A new RO1 on vault engineering was funded by NIH in 2005. For the past four years, vault function research at UCLA has been possible because of the generous support from The G. Harold and Leila Y. Mathers Charitable Foundation. Vault engineering research was initiated by a NIRT Grant from the National Science Foundation that began in 2002 and will conclude in the fall of 2006. A small (but timely) grant from the Oxnard foundation has also been very helpful.
In addition, vault research over the past 15 years has been greatly stimulated by past grants from the Margaret E. Early Foundation, the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, the UC BioStar program (in partnership with Amgen), the Eli Lilly Corporation, and the National Cancer Institute.
