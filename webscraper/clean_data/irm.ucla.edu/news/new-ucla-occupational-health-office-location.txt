New UCLA Occupational Health Office Location

March 31, 2022
Dear Colleagues:
We are excited to announce that Occupational Health moved to a newly renovated location.
The new office opened, March 1, 2022, on the first floor main lobby of CHS, near Café Med.
New Occupational Health
10833 Le Conte Avenue, Suite 17-240 CHS
Los Angeles, CA 90095
Occupational Health offers a virtual queue for TB testing only. This new feature allows staff to “join the line” from their office and receive a text when it is their turn to be tested.
For additional information, please call (310) 825-6771.
We look forward to seeing you at the new clinic!
