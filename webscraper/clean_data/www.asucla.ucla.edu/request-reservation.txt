Alumni & Off-Campus
The UCLA campus, with its many resources and attractions, offers an environment that will enrich any event. Just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean, its location on the West Side of Los Angeles affords easy access to the abundant recreational sites and cultural centers visitors want to see.
While on the campus itself, guests will enjoy viewing the numerous gardens and museums accenting the 419-acre campus – not to mention college basketball’s fabled Pauley Pavilion.
We at UCLA Student Union Event Services have the perfect location – in the heart of the UCLA campus – for your conference, reception, performance or trade show. We can coordinate all of your event needs including technical equipment, catering and staffing. Our event planning experience paired with personalized services will make your event an occasion to remember.

We can coordinate all of your event needs including technical equipment, catering and staffing. Our event planning experience paired with personalized services will make your event special.
Past events have ranged from banquets for a teachers’ group to trade association meetings and temple services. Small weddings and large receptions have both found a home in our event space. In addition to Ackerman Grand Ballroom, one of the largest and most flexible assembly areas on campus, we offer smaller rooms nearby for receptions, break-out sessions, child care, or other complementary uses.
Like all campus venues, we use UCLA Events Online (EOL) to register and confirm your department reservation. Your event manager will initiate the EOL application once you make a reservation. Please click here to access EOL.
