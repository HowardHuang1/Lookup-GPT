Work On Campus
Our locations are right on campus, so don’t spend a lot of time (unpaid time!) traveling to and from work.
Résumé Building
Whether you’re headed for a job or for graduate school, you’ll find your ASUCLA experience can help set you apart from other applicants.
Bonus Programs
Exceptional performance awards, spot bonus awards, and an employee referral program are all opportunities for student employees to receive a little extra cash for their extra efforts.
Meal Allowance
If you work for ASUCLA Restaurants, you get a meal for about half price on the days you work, not to mention free soft drinks!
Rapid Promotion Schedule
Every department has its student supervisors and senior supervisors. ASUCLA Restaurants promotes more than half of its student employees to supervisory positions. So your starting wage is just that, only a start!
