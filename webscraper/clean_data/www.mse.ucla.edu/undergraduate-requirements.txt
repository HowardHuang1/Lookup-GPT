Undergraduate Requirements
There are two areas of specialization for undergraduate students in Materials Science and Engineering. Both offer Bachelor of Science degrees. In both cases, students are encouraged to take elective courses in advanced materials, as well as classes in presentation skills and undergraduate research opportunities.
Materials Engineering option
: This is the regular sequence of courses for students in the field of MSE. Students take classes in different materials systems and processes.
Electronic Materials option
: This sequence combines materials engineering courses with courses in electrical engineering.
This is a more restrictive major with fewer options outside of the MSE and EE courses. The electronic materials option typically attracts about one third to one half of our undergraduate students.
The basic curriculum provides the required background in mathematics, chemistry, physics and engineering sciences. Advanced studies include all classes of materials and the inter-relationships among processing, structure, properties, and performance are addressed throughout the Program. The curriculum provides the students with the tools necessary to analyze, design and utilize materials and materials systems and devices, and after graduation, to work as a professional in Materials Science and Engineering. The curriculum culminates in a senior design course. Additionally, engineering design is incorporated into a number of other MSE courses. Students gain laboratory experience in several classes; undergraduate research projects also provide laboratory experience for students. The curriculum offers additional instruction in the development of communication skills required for a successful engineering career. The freshman seminar addresses the development of critical thinking skills in the context of societal and global issues, oral and written communication skills, and a general awareness of the ethical and professional responsibilities of scientists and
engineers. The students’ writing and communication skills are further developed in courses aimed at rhetoric and composition, written and oral communication, each of the laboratory courses, and senior design project.
