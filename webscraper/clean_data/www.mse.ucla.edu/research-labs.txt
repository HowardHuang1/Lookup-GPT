Archaeomaterials Group
(
Dr. Ioanna Kakoulli
&
Dr. Mark S. Goorsky
)
Research Lab Description: The Archaeomaterials Group, a joint venture between the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology was established to assist in archaeological research of anthropological significance, to promote innovative research in ancient materials and technologies and to develop synergistic activities and sharing of knowledge among universities and museums. Courses and supervised research in the field of study and conservation of artifacts will offer opportunities for advanced education and training of young researchers in archaeological science.

Electronic Materials Group
(
Dr. Mark S. Goorsky
)
Research Lab Description: The research programs in my group focus on the relationship between structural and chemical irregularities in solid state electronic materials and the effect that these defects have on the performance of devices fabricated from these materials. We primarily collaborate with industrial and government laboratories to provide a synergistic effort to study these issues. In particular, we use non-destructive techniques to study the evolution of defects in these structures. One of the main characterizations techniques we employ is reciprocal space mapping through
triple axis x-ray diffraction.

Hybrid & Multi-Phase Materials Laboratory
(
Dr. Jenn-Ming Yang
)
Research Lab Description: Our effort is to create a science base in quantitative relations between the microstructural parameters and macroscopic mechanical response of high temperature composites. Such relationships would permit dependable engineering of composite structural components for safe and reliable service at elevated temperatures. We are conducting experimental and theoretical work to study the significant issues on mechanisms and mechanics of deformation and fracture of high temperature composites. We are developing several high temperature materials with an industrial collaborators, such as Cr(Mo)/NiAl eutectic composite and oxide/oxide eutectic fibers (Y3Al5O12/Al2O3 and Al2O3/ZrO2(Y2O3)) using the directional solidification technique. Currently, we are conducting experimental work to study the kinetics and mechanisms of microstructural instability as well the creep and strength degradation deformation mechanisms. We are investigating the sintering and mechanical behavior of nano-sized Si3N4 and SiC for high temperature applications.

Prof. Balandin’s Research Group
(
Dr. Alexander A. Balandin
)
Research Lab Description: Professor Balandin’s Research Group conducts research focused on understanding the properties of quantum and strongly correlated materials and developing new electronic, optical, magnonic, and energy conversion devices based on such materials. The group uses cleanroom nanofabrication to build and test prototype electronic devices with 1D and 2D van der Waals quantum materials; prepared composites with unique functionalities; utilize advanced instrumentation to study the properties of materials, including Raman and Brillouin – Mandelstam spectroscopy, thermal characterization equipment, electronic noise spectroscopy, semiconductor device testing, and various types of microscopy. The Balandin Group’s experimental facilities at UCLA consist of the Nano-Device Laboratory (UCLA NDL) and the Phonon Optimized Engineered Materials Laboratory (UCLA POEM).

Soft Materials Research Lab
(
Dr. Qibing Pei
)
Research Lab Description: Professor Pei’s Soft Materials Research Laboratory studies electronic polymers and nanostructured hybrid materials. The research focuses on molecular design and nano-scale engineering for the development of new polymers and nano-structures with desired electronic and/or mechanical properties. The applications of these materials are many folds, including flexible electronics, artificial muscles, photovoltaics,
wind energy generation, radiation detection, and biologically-inspired systems to name a few.

Prof. Dunn’s Lab
(
Dr. Bruce S. Dunn
)
Research Lab Description: Research in the Dunn group involves the synthesis of inorganic and hybrid materials and characterization of their
electrical and optical properties. One of the principal themes which extends to most of the research activities is the use of sol-gel methods to synthesize a number of the materials studied in the group. This synthetic approach enables us to prepare materials which incorporate a wide variety of organic and biological dopants and are capable of developing unique microstructures and properties.
