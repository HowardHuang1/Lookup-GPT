What Is I-Corps?
The I-Corps program was created by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2011 to facilitate the transition of academic research to market. The NSF offers select teams the opportunity to participate in a fast-paced and rigorous program that helps move products out of the lab and into the market by giving researchers hands-on experience with the challenges of customer discovery.
In the I-Corps™ environment, teams are pushed, challenged, and questioned to help them quickly learn whether or not their ideas are worth pursuing.
