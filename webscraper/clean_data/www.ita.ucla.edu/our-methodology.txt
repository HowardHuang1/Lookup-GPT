Before Your Course
Teams are asked to attend the I-Corps™ course having already completed a business canvas. This video was created by Alexander Osterwalder, co-author of Business Model Generation.
This page contains several videos to assist in learning the Lean LaunchPad® methodology. The videos are arranged by topic and include instructional videos that show real-life examples of faculty critiquing teams during their presentations.
