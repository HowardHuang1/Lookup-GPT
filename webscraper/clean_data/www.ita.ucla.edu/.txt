What is I-CORPS?
I-Corps is an entrepreneurial training program and funding opportunity to get you out of the lab to evaluate the market opportunity.
The primary purpose of the NSF I-Corps is to support the transition of laboratory discoveries into breakthrough innovations, and reduce the risk associated with taking innovations from the lab to the marketplace.
We are proudly part of
I-Corps Hubwest
