Dean's Certification
A letter of clearance (Dean's Certification) is verification that you, as a UCLA student, have not violated any University policies or been subject to any disciplinary actions or proceedings. These letters are usually required by graduate and professional schools, state bar associations, government agencies, or independent agencies when applying for admission or employment. Most of these institutions will provide you with a form for you to fill out and the Office of the Dean of Students to complete. Our office will fill out the form, or attach our own letter of clearance when applicable.
Dean's Certifications may be requested in-person, by mail (1104 Murphy Hall, Box 951415, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1415), fax (310-825-8616), or email (
dean@saonet.ucla.edu
), or the online form (link below).

The Office of the Dean of Students charges for Dean Certification forms. The fee for Dean's Certification is $5.00 for each copy sent (additional requests made at the same time will be charged $5.00 each after the initial $5.00 fee).
This fee will be charged to your BruinBill account, accessed through the URSA website. Even if you are no longer at the university, you still have access to your BruinBill account. Any unpaid charges will result in a hold on your records and registration.
If you have any questions about this process, you may call (310) 825-3871 or during normal business hours, Monday through Friday from 9:00am to 5:00pm.
