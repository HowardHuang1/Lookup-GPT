Parents are often confused and concerned when they discover that their son or daughter is charged with violating University policy. The
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA) protects student privacy and requires that our Office maintain strict confidentiality when discussing student disciplinary files. Our Office encourages students to discuss their discipline case with their parents, and parents are encouraged to speak with their student before contacting our Office. Our staff members are available to discuss the student disciplinary process at UCLA with parents who may have concerns. You may also find the
