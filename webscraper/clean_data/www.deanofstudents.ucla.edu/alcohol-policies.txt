Alcohol Policies
It is important for UCLA students to familiarize themselves with the policies and expectations of the University regarding alcohol use and consumption on the campus and/or at officially sponsored University events. Since violations of the alcohol policies are taken seriously, we encourage all students to educate themselves by reviewing the related documents.
As part of UCLA's comprehensive and proactive approach to help ensure that students stay safe and healthy, the University is asking each first-year and transfer student to complete AlcoholEdu for College, an online alcohol education and prevention program.
