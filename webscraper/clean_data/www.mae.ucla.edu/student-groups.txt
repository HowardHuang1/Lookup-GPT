Student Groups
The MAE Department supports many student groups that provide opportunities for MAE students to enhance the material that they learn in their classes with practical hands-on projects, and opportunities to gain valuable leadership, team building, and communication skills. Many of these groups also host industry info sessions, resume review sessions, and other opportunities to interact with industry professionals and alumni in an informal setting. Additional information on the activities of these groups can be found on their websites, which are listed below.
