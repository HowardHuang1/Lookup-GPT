Outstanding Degree Awards
The Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department annually issues the Outstanding BS, MS, and PhD awards to graduating students. The Awards and Honors Committee select the winner based on various criteria; including but not limited to the student’s GPA, research activities, publications, extra-curricular activities, etc. Should there not be a strong candidate to receive an outstanding degree award, the award will not be issued for that year.
