Professor CJ Kim, in collaboration with UCSB, awarded a $1M research award from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
Feb 12, 2024
Professor CJ Kim, in collaboration with Prof. Paolo Luzzatto-Fegiz at UC Santa Barbara, has won a $1M (18 months) research award from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Managed by the Defense Science Office (DSO) of DARPA, the funded research is to help reduce hydrodynamic drag of ships that will increase speed, extend endurance, reduce fuel usage, and tame emissions. Leveraging their recent success in developing microtrench superhydrophobic surfaces and confirming their drag-reducing capability under a motorboat in nearby Marina del Rey, the research team led by Prof. Kim will develop a set of design tools that can predict if drag reduction is possible on a given engineered surface and, if possible, how much reduction is obtainable on the surface.
