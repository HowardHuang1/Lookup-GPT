Minor Fields of Study
Applied Mathematics (syllabus) [Updated 1/28/2021]
A student who  elects Applied Mathematics as a minor field will be held responsible for the body of knowledge contained in a coherent group of courses to be approved in advance by the Field Committee. The program must comprise at least 12 quarter units in graduate work. Committee approval of any proposed course work group will depend on such factors as the student’s major field interests, and the breadth of his or her prior mathematical course work record.
A student may satisfy the field requirements by achieving satisfactory grades in a group of courses selected as follows:
1. Three graduate courses from the Mathematics department:
https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/courses-2/
2. Two graduate courses from the Mathematics department plus one additional undergraduate course from the Mathematics department (requires the approval of the Applied Mathematics  field committee chair).
3. Two graduate courses from the Mathematics department plus one additional graduate course containing a high math content from Samueli Engineering (requires the approval of the Applied Mathematics field committee chair).
I
n addition to the graduate course work, students in this
minor
field are expected to be familiar with the basic material in linear algebra, differential equations, functions of complex variables, and partial differential equations.
Students formally enrolled in an approved program of courses as outlined above, and who achieve grades of “B” or better in all courses, and at least one “A,” will be deemed to have completed the minor field requirement.
A transfer student may petition the Field Committee for permission to list one course taken at another institution in his or her approved course group, provided that the course was taken by the student in graduate status.
