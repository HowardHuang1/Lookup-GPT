Successful 2024 MAE Town Hall
Feb 12, 2024
AIAA at UCLA hosted a successful and productive 2024 MAE Town Hall on January 17th, bringing together students and faculty to communicate and work together, taking on student concerns as opportunities to find solutions. To complement the serious discussions and to build community, AIAA also hosted trivia at the Town Hall. Attendees competed to guess fun facts that emphasize the UCLA MAE department’s many achievements over the years– such as how 8 Bruins so far have flown into space since 1963, and how Rocket Project at UCLA recently beat their own intercollegiate world record, reaching 22,437ft!
