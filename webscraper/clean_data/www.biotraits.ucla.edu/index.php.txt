Welcome to the
Global Biotraits Database
.
This is an
online resource for empirical data on how biological traits
respond to environmental
drivers such as temperature, light, and salinity.
This database represents the largest and most comprehensive database for the thermal responses of physiological and ecological traits, especially consumer-resource interactions. Currently, we have a total of 2445 intraspecific trait response curves from a total of 1508 species.
We
expect researchers of diverse disciplines to use these
data
to shed
light on how natural
systems respond to environmental drivers.
From this site, users will be able to download available datasets and
upload their own data. We hope that this website will become a central
portal for the management and accession of data on the thermal responses
of biological traits.
We
are currently working through a few bugs with the search capibilities,
but please feel free to try a search. In the meantime,
the
full dataset published in
Ecology
(2013) can be downloaded
here
.
Work on the website is funded by the
NSF grant
to
Van
Savage
and
Priyanga Amarasekare
.
Please contact
us
if you have questions, including if you would like
to help out or submit data.
Thanks,
Global Biotraits Database team

of our paper describing how the dimensionality of consumer search
space (i.e., 2D vs. 3D) drives trophic interaction strengths, and
ultimately may be responisble for community differences between aquatic
and terrestrial habitats.
