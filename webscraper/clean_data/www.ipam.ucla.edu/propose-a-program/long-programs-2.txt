Propose a Program
IPAM seeks program proposals from the mathematical, statistical, and scientific communities for long programs, workshops, and summer schools.  Most program proposals are reviewed at IPAM’s Science Advisory Board meeting, held in November each year.  Programs are selected on the basis of their scientific impact and contribution to IPAM’s goals of improving equity, diversity and inclusion in mathematics and other sciences.  If you would like to discuss your program ideas and prepare a proposal for IPAM's consideration, you are encouraged to
contact the IPAM Director
.
Long Programs
Summer Schools
Workshops
Long Programs generally have several complementary streams: one mathematical and one (or more) from other scientific disciplines where there is the potential for a fruitful and exciting interaction. For some programs, the different streams might draw from disparate branches of mathematics.  In evaluating proposals, IPAM looks for programs that:
Are timely and are likely to have substantial scientific impact
Have a strong connection with one or more mathematical fields and will result in progress in those fields and/or expansion of applications of these fields
Present a high likelihood of creation of a new scientific community by leveraging common interests presented by the component streams of a long program
Will be able to substantially contribute to the goals of improving equity, diversity and inclusion in mathematics and other sciences
Contribute to development of human resources by providing training opportunities for junior researchers
IPAM’s Science Advisory Board makes long program selections approximately 2 years prior to the start of a program.
Typical Long Program Structure
IPAM runs two long programs in each academic year.  Each long program is 14 weeks in duration.  The Fall program runs from early September to mid-December; the Spring program runs from early March to mid-June.
A long program opens with tutorials representing the different streams of the program during the first week of the program. This is followed by three or four workshops, each lasting one week, plus a culminating workshop at Lake Arrowhead. The workshops provide an opportunity to bring in a group of experts on several of the most exciting topics in the area of the program.
A substantial number of program participants (“core participants”) stay at IPAM for the length of the program.  This diverse group of mathematicians and other scientists nucleate the scientific community that will be built in the course of the program. Core participants represent each stream of the program and include researchers at all career stages.  A dozen or more senior scientists from academia or government are essential to provide leadership and mentoring.  They are matched by similar numbers of mid-career and early-career researchers, including graduate students.  Core participants are selected through an application available on the IPAM web site.
Long Program Proposals
A successful long program proposal should aim to discuss the following topics:
The organizing committee.
Please designate one organizer as the lead contact for the proposal.  Please comment on each of the organizer’s likelihood to be available to spend the entire program (or a substantial portion) at IPAM.
Scientific aspects of the program (1-2 pages).
What are the component streams that make up the program? Why is a program combining these streams timely?  What common topics and developments are likely to be the outcome of the program?
Who might be the potential key core participants?
It is not necessary to solicit commitment from these at the time of the application.  Of particular interest would be a list of key participants that are likely to stay during the entire program, who would represent the different scientific themes of the program and help mentor junior core participants. Often such participants are more senior. Mid-career and more junior participants are typically selected through an application process.
Broader impacts of the program (1 page).
How will the program contribute to the Institute’s mission of equity, diversity and inclusion in mathematics and other sciences?  What will be done during the program to help with EDI issues related to the specific scientific streams that make up the program?  How will the program ensure involvement of women and members of underrepresented communities at all stages of program planning and execution?  These goals should also be kept in mind when creating organizing committees for all the long program activities.
The structure of the program (4-6 pages):
what will be the component workshops (usually 4 workshops)? For each workshop, describe its scientific theme (0.25-0.5 page), list a potential organizing committee, and provide a list of 30 or so potential speakers.  The workshop organizers may or may not be core participants in the program.  If appropriate, please highlight the scientific fields represented by speakers and organizers, and whether they belong to an under-represented group.
Other activities during the program:
list any other activities that would help achieve the scientific and broader impact goals of the program. Examples include public lectures or demonstrations, or specific activities during non-workshop weeks, such as panels focusing on EDI issues, career advice, grant-writing, etc.
Industrial Partners (optional)
: List possible partners in industry, government, or at National Labs. If appropriate, mention if such partnerships might result in additional funding for the program.
You may also wish to discuss your ideas with the
Director
, the
Deputy Director
, or the
Associate Director
.  We are more than happy to provide feedback on drafts of proposals prior to their formal submission.
Long program applications are due on
September 30
of each year.
