NSF Grants
A successful proposal to the National Science Foundation in 2000 created IPAM and supported its activities for the first five years. The
NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS)
continues to provide generous support to IPAM in five year increments, and remains the primary source of IPAM’s operating budget.
The NSF requires annual reports that describe the activities of the institute for one year and that present the results and impact of those activities. The fiscal year for a report has changed with each grant period; currently it is September 1 to August 31. The reports are submitted approximately nine months after the year ends. The reports are written according to NSF reporting requirements for an NSF reader. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the NSF.
