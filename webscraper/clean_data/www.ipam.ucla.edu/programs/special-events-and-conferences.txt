Special Events and Conferences
In addition to its usual portfolio of programs, IPAM may be invited to host and cosponsor other programs that support its mission and priorities.  These programs may include workshops sponsored by government agencies, military research offices, and corporations; programs that are designed to service specific communities that are underrepresented in mathematics, including African Americans, Latinos, and women; and annual meetings of national organizations.
