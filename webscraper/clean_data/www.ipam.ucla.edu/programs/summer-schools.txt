Summer Schools
Most years, IPAM offers an intensive one-, two- or three-week “summer school” dedicated to an important scientific theme involving problems of mathematical interest.  The program includes tutorial lectures as well as research lectures given by leaders in the field.  Some summer schools offer a “hands-on” component.  The program announcement and application are posted in December each year. Graduate students and recent PhDs are welcome to apply.  Participants are generally offered on-campus accommodations. IPAM records most of the Summer School lectures and posts the videos online; you will find them in the
video archive
.
