Overview
The
Challenge Institute for Quantum Computation (CIQC
), the
Advanced Molecular Architectures for Quantum Information Science (AMAQIS)
, and IPAM are pleased to present the fourth annual Winter School in Quantum Information Science. This year’s school will turn its focus to Quantum Information Science for Chemistry and will provide both in-depth primers and surveys of current areas of active research in atomic, molecular, and materials systems for quantum information science applications, as well as quantum algorithms alongside methods of “usual” quantum chemistry.  Topics that will be included in this winter school include:
Introduction to Quantum Information
Classical Quantum Chemistry and QIS applications
Optical Cycling Centers
Quantum Algorithms for Chemistry
Molecular Spin Qubits
The school is aimed at early career participants, including graduate students, experimentalists, computational scientists, and theorists working in quantum information science and related disciplines. We aim to convene a multidisciplinary group of students and researchers who will disseminate and accelerate developments in the field, and to draw on their own research to help inspire new approaches and application domains. Applications are now being accepted. Financial support will be offered  to young researchers subject to demonstrated need and availability.
The application deadline is December 10.
