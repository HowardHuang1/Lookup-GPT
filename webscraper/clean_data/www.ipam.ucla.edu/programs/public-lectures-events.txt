Public Lectures
IPAM offers occasional lectures and other special events that are open to the public and appeal to a broad audience.  This includes our annual
Green Family Lectures Series
, featuring a speaker of international stature, held every spring since 2012.  Public lectures are typically held in an auditorium on campus, followed by a reception at IPAM.  For some events, an RSVP is required.  IPAM records all public lectures and posts the videos online; you will find them in the program archive.
