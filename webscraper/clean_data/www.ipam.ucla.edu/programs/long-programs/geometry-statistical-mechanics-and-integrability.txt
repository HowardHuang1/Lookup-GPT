Overview
In the last 20-30 years probability theory and statistical mechanics
have been revitalized with the introduction of tools from geometry,
notably conformal geometry and discrete analyticity, but also algebraic
geometry and integrable systems.
Recent connections between classical and discrete geometric structures
on surfaces, and combinatorial models such as the dimer model, Ising
model and the Tutte polynomial reveal a significant connection with
geometry, notably hyperbolic geometry and polyhedra. Other recent work
on the dimer model has led to connections with knot theory, Lorentzian
geometry, and symplectic geometry. From another direction, the
combinatorics of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian has connections
with the dimer model. Likewise, the isotropic Grassmannian and
orthogonal Grassmannian have connections with spanning trees and the
Ising model.
Finally, there are well-known connections between some statistical
mechanics models and representation theory, such as Young diagrams,
Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, Knutson-Tao puzzles and Littlewood-Richardson
coefficients and their generalizations. The Bethe Ansatz and the
Yang-Baxter equation were developed for the 6-vertex model but are now
fundamental tools in combinatorial representation theory.
This program will bring together researchers in this somewhat disparate
realm of ideas, united by the underlying themes of geometry and
statistical mechanics.
