Workshops
IPAM sponsors workshops on a broad range of scientific themes. Some workshops are part of an IPAM long program. Long program participants who are in residence at IPAM, attend all of the workshops in the program, while others visit IPAM for just one workshop.  Other workshops, including our winter workshop series, are stand-alone.  Most workshops are five days and feature 20 to 25 speakers.   Exploratory workshops, which address an emerging problem or new application of math, are two or three days in length.  Participants may apply for travel support to attend a workshop, or may simply register online.  IPAM records most of the workshop lectures and posts the videos online; you will find them in the program archive.
