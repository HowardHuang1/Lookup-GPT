IPAM offers several versions of its Research in Industrial Projects for Students (RIPS) program, a summer research experience for students of math and related disciplines.  Students work in teams on projects sponsored by industry.   The application process begins in November for the following summer.  Undergraduate students may apply to RIPS-LA and RIPS-Singapore; graduate students may apply to GRIPS-Berlin or GRIPS-Sendai, for a specific project.  Please check the webpages for application deadlines and details.
