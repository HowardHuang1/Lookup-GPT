Long Programs
Long programs bring together researchers from mathematics and other disciplines, or multiple areas of mathematics, with the goal of facilitating collaborative, cross-disciplinary research. Senior, mid-career and junior researchers from around the world convene at IPAM for three months.  The long program opens with a week of tutorials, which are followed by several (usually four) workshops on topics related to the overall theme of the program, and a culminating workshop at UCLA’s Lake Arrowhead Conference Center. Between the workshops, the participants organize a seminar series and other activities.  IPAM offers housing and travel support to participants of long programs.  An application is available online.
