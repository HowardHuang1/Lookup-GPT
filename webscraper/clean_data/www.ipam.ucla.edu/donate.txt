Whether one is seeking algorithms to locate disease genes, designing and predicting the properties of new materials, modeling the effect of economic changes on our climate, or discovering new methods to design trajectories for exploring the solar system, the need for cutting-edge, innovative mathematics is critical in many fields. Fostering new mathematical techniques and training a new generation of mathematical scientists who will develop and use them lies at the heart of IPAM’s mission.
IPAM Giving Opportunities:
Make a Match
Dean Miguel García-Garibay is dedicating resources to recognize the urgency to address social justice priorities and the critical need to increase the diversity of our faculty, staff, and student body.
Qualifying gifts of $100,000 to $1 million to IPAM’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion endowment will be matched at 100%. For example, a $500,000 gift will become $1,000,000.
Director’s Endowment Fund
Your generous support will go toward fulfilling high priority needs that cannot be supported by federal grants, such as family expenses for participants, supplemental support for participants who cannot afford the cost of living in Los Angeles, and other special needs.
Berland Foundation / Child Care Funds
PAM offers assistance for workshop and long program participants with young children. IPAM’s child care resources webpage and program staff helps them locate and arrange child care. A gift from the Berland Foundation has made it possible to offer child care grants to participants with primary parenting responsibility for young children, so that the parent can fully participate in the IPAM program. Help us expand our scope my making a contribution to this fund.
IPAM’s Frontiers Society
Your annual membership in IPAM’s Frontiers Society will help us continue to run high-quality programs attracting both internationally renowned experts as well as promising young scholars. There are three levels of membership: Innovator ($200), Visionary ($1,000), and Champion ($2,000). Couples may join with a single membership.
Donor Wall
Donors giving $7,500 or more will be recognized on IPAM’s Donor Wall.
Name a Seat!
With a gift of $2,000, you may name a seat in IPAM’s lecture hall, renovated in 2014 (see picture).  During and since our 15th Anniversary Campaign, IPAM donors named 36 of the 75 eligible seats. A plaque appears on the back of the seat with the name of the donor or someone the donor chooses to honor.  We will continue to offer this opportunity until all seats are named.  A gift at this level also qualifies the donor for Frontiers Society membership at the Champion level.
Please help IPAM carry out its mission by making a contribution online. If you prefer to donate by mail, please print
