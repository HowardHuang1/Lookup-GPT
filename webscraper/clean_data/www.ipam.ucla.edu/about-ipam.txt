About IPAM
IPAM was founded in 2000 by Mark Green, Tony Chan, and Eitan Tadmor as an
NSF Mathematical Sciences Institute
with a grant from the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences.   Over 2,000 visitors per year attend its workshops, long programs, student research programs, summer schools, and other programs.
IPAM seeks to bring the full range of mathematical techniques to bear on the great scientific challenges of our time.  We sponsor programs that bring together researchers from different disciplines or from different areas of mathematics, with the goal of sparking interdisciplinary collaboration that continues long after the IPAM program ends.
IPAM is located in the heart of the UCLA campus, adjacent to the Mathematical Sciences Building and directly across from Moore Hall. Its building was designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Frank Gehry. It boasts an open and spacious design with large windows that flood the interior with light. The building offers plenty of office space for visiting scholars, a lecture hall, several other meeting rooms, and public areas equipped with whiteboards, ideal for group discussions and informal learning.
Supporting the careers of women and minority mathematicians and scientists is an important component of IPAM’s mission. Read about IPAM’s
