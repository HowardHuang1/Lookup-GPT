Child Care Resources
If you are visiting IPAM and will be bringing a child or children, please notify your Program Coordinator.  The information on this page is meant for long program participants seeking child care or babysitting services. Single workshop visitors seeking babysitting services may also find some of this information useful. If your child is of school-age (kindergarten and above), your Program Coordinator can assist you.
CHILD CARE CENTERS
Below you will find a list of child care facilities that may consider admitting your child/children on short-term basis. We advise you to contact them well in advance to inquire about space availability and waiting lists. Please note that IPAM does not recommend or endorse any particular child care center or preschool.
