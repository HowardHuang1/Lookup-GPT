Hotels
***IPAM does not hire any outside company to make hotel reservations for our program participants, or share the names and email addresses of our participants with an outside party.  If you are contacted by a business that claims to represent IPAM and offers to book a hotel room for you, it is likely a scam.  Please notify your program coordinator and do not accept their services.***
DESIGNATED HOTEL
For most workshops and summer schools, IPAM blocks rooms at a local hotel or hotels. Your invitation letter (if you are receiving IPAM support) and the workshop’s lodging page, which is linked to the program’s web page, provides instructions for reserving a hotel room. In order to retain our special rate, we encourage you to use the designated hotel for your workshop if at all possible. IPAM’s designated hotels are marked with an asterisk in the list below.
COMPLETE LIST OF HOTELS
The list below includes moderately priced hotels and a few luxury hotels, in alphabetical order and grouped by location. Most of you will choose to stay near UCLA, in Westwood, which will allow you to walk to IPAM. We also list some hotels in West LA, including Santa Monica and Brentwood, which require a short commute by car or bus. Finally, we provide information for a few hotels near the airport (LAX) for those who have early morning return flights.
Rates may change without our knowledge; please check the hotel webpage for current rates. If you have travel support from IPAM, please note the amount you have been awarded for lodging on your invitation letter before booking a room.
For visitors who cannot easily walk from the hotel to IPAM, please note which hotels offer shuttle service, or contact your Program Manager for advice.
