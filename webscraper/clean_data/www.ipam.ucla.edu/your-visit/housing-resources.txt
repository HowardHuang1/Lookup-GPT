Housing Resources
This guide is intended for the use of participants who will be in residence at IPAM for a long program. Your offer letter from IPAM includes the amount of your housing allowance. If you will be in-residence for at least one month, we recommend you look for a furnished apartment to rent, since renting a hotel room for a long period may be cost-prohibitive. For those who will be in town for less than a month at a time, you may have to rent a room at a hotel or via a vacation rental service (such as Airbnb, see below), as most landlords will not sign a lease for less than a month.
Because rent is high in Los Angeles, IPAM encourages long program participants to share an apartment when possible. If you know someone attending the same program with you and are interested in sharing an apartment with him/her, please make arrangements privately. If you do not know anyone and would like to find a roommate, please email our
housing coordinator
.
Please find the section below that addresses your needs.
GENERAL INFORMATION
Scams
IPAM does not hire any outside company to make lodging reservations for our program participants, or share the names and email addresses of our participants with an outside party.  If you are contacted by a business that claims to represent IPAM and offers to book lodging  for you, it is likely a scam. Please notify your program coordinator and do not accept their services.
Please read the
link
offered by the FTC regarding potential housing scams and make sure to send all lease agreements to the
housing coordinator
for review before signing any contracts or sending money to a potential landlord.
Map
Please access the following link for the
map of Westwood
(the location of UCLA) and nearby areas. This will give you a better idea of the neighborhoods near campus and assist you in choosing a preferred location for your stay.
When to start looking for housing
Please consider contacting rental companies
at least
1-2 months before the date you intend to move in. While some rentals will be able to settle your lease contract a long time before your actual arrival, others will ask you to contact them at a later date.
Apartment search tips
Questions that you should consider to ask while inquiring about housing:
Is the apartment furnished?
Does it provide housewares, such as linens, dishes, and utensils?
Does the rent include utilities?
Does it include internet and cable?
How far is it from UCLA campus?
Are there nearby bus stops?
Is it a quiet neighborhood, and/or are there student tenants around?
Is parking provided?
Furniture Rental
Most short-term rental properties come furnished; if you rent an apartment that is not furnished, you may rent furniture and housewares from any of the following companies (Please note that IPAM cannot reimburse for furniture rental expenses.)
Fashion Furniture Rental
Cort Furniture Rental
Brook Furniture Rental
