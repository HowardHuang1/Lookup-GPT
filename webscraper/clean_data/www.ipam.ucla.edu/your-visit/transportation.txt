Transportation
Below you will find information on several modes of transportation that we recommend for travel from the airport to UCLA and around Westwood and Los Angeles.
VIA BUS:
The
UCLA Campus Shuttle
runs weekdays 7 am to 7 pm (excluding holidays, reduced hours in summer) and arrive at stops approximately every 8-10 minutes. One route provides round-trip service from northeast campus to Westwood Village. The shuttle stop closest to IPAM is located across the street from Murphy Hall on Charles E. Young Dr. (look for the Campus Shuttle sign).
The Big Blue Bus
serves West Los Angeles and Santa Monica. Routes 1, 2, and 8 pick up at the corner of Hilgard and Westholme (a short walk from IPAM) and go to destinations such as the Santa Monica and Venice beaches, the Third Street Promenade and other shopping areas, and the Metro light rail station (Expo line). The fare is $1.25 per trip.
The Metro Bus
serves most of LA. Take the Metro 720 (Wilshire Blvd. at Westwood Blvd.) westbound towards Santa Monica or eastbound to downtown Los Angeles. Metro Bus 2 eastbound (Hilgard at Westholme) will take you into Hollywood and downtown Los Angeles. The base fare is $1.75.
The Culver City Bus
serves West Los Angeles and Culver City. Route 6 picks up at Westwood Plaza in front of the NPI building (a short walk from IPAM) and ends at LAX. The base fare is $1.00.
VIA TAXI:
Taxis:
We recommend that you request pickup or drop off at the UCLA Faculty Center (480 Charles E. Young Dr. East), a short walk from IPAM. The program coordinator can place the request for you and direct you to the pickup location. You can also walk about 2 blocks to the Westwood W Hotel on Hilgard Ave. There is always a line of available cabs outside the front entrance.
Beverly Hills Cab: (310) 273-6611
VIA SHUTTLE:
Shuttle Service:
You may arrange for transportation to LAX or other destinations through one of these shuttle services. The cost is typically less than a taxi. They will require a credit card number when you place your reservation. We suggest you arrange for pick-up at the UCLA Faculty Center (480 Charles E. Young Dr. East) or at your hotel or apartment.
