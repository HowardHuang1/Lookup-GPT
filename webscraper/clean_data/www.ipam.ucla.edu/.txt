Institute for Pure & Applied Mathematics
IPAM fosters the interaction of mathematics with a broad range of science and technology, builds new interdisciplinary research communities, promotes mathematical innovation, and engages and transforms the world through mathematics.
IPAM fulfills its mission through workshops and other programs that connect mathematics and other disciplines or multiple areas of mathematics. These activities bring in thousands of visitors annually from academia, government and industry. As an NSF Mathematical Sciences Institute, IPAM serves the international scientific community. IPAM also engages the local community through its public lecture series.

From our Participants
“
IPAM has had a significant impact on my research. Not only do the programs lead to unexpected collaborations and new research directions, they have led to a community with long-term continuity in which meaningful cooperative efforts between disciplines can be established.
”
Graeme Henkelman
,
Chemistry professor at the University of Texas; most recently participated in
Materials for a Sustainable Energy Future,
2013.
