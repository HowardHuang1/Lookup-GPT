Your Visit
IPAM welcomes over a thousand visitors each year to its workshops, meetings, long programs, summer programs, and other events. IPAM’s program, finance, and IT staff work to ensure that each visitor’s experience is pleasant and productive.
Please follow the links on the left for information on IPAM’s Community Agreement, reimbursement policies and procedures, local accommodations, child care, ground transportation, and helpful resources and facts about UCLA and Los Angeles. Long program participants in particular, who will visit IPAM for an extended period, will want to read the Resident’s Guide, Housing Resources, and Technology pages.
If you have any questions prior to your visit to IPAM, please contact an IPAM staff member.
