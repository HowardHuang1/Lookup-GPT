Funding Priorities
We seek the support of friends who share our vision and are willing to help to forward it. Your donation will help us to enrich and improve IPAM’s programs and initiatives, including:
Improvements to our Facilities.
Upkeep and enhancement of IPAM’s space is essential in ensuring a healthy and safe workplace. IPAM continuously needs to replace furniture, update our kitchen and bar area, and upgrade our video equipment every 4 years. We also plan to improve and re-design our outside patio areas in the near future. These enhancements cannot be supported by NSF funding. Your gift will help create and maintain a safe and welcoming place for our participants and the math community.
Child Care Fund.
Help IPAM support participants whose active participation in the program is dependent on securing reliable, full- or part-time care for a young child or children. A generous donation from the Berland Foundation has made this program possible, but we seek additional support so that we may serve more participants attending IPAM workshops and long programs.
Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.
IPAM advocates for and recognizes the critical need to increase the diversity in gender, ethnicity, and ideas in STEM fields. Help IPAM improve EDI in all of its activities.
