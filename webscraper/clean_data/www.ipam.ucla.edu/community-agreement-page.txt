Community Agreement
Community Agreement
All IPAM participants are expected to familiarize themselves with and follow the IPAM community agreement.
IPAM aims to offer a rewarding, enlightening, supportive, and fruitful experience to every participant. We will build that rich experience together by devoting our strongest available effort to all activities. Please be prepared to take an active, patient, and generous role in your own development and that of the other participants.
IPAM is committed to creating a professional and welcoming environment that benefits from the diversity of experiences of all its participants. We aim to offer the same respect, opportunity and value to the contributions of every participant regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, or veteran status. IPAM asks you to contribute to this positive environment, and to use extra care to ensure that your words and actions communicate respect for others.
IPAM talks will be recorded with the permission of the speaker and disseminated to a wider audience on our website and via social media platforms. In preparing for the talk, please be mindful of its lasting impact beyond its initial presentation. IPAM reserves the right to remove any online materials or videos contributed by its participants.
Discriminatory or harassing behavior undermines the mission of IPAM. IPAM does not tolerate sexual harassment, other forms of harassment, or sexual assault, in-person or online, and reserves the right to sanction individuals involved who are not in compliance with this agreement, including their removal from the IPAM event.
If you witness a crime, call 911. If you feel uncomfortable with the way you or others are being treated or have concerns, please see an IPAM staff member, or contact IPAM by e-mail (anonymously, if you wish) at
ipamrp@g.ucla.edu
(which only the Chief Administrative Officer has access to). All reports will be handled in the strictest confidentiality to the extent permitted by UCLA policy on mandated reporters. You can also use the “report incident” button on the UCLA EDI website
https://equity.ucla.edu/
, or e-mail the NSF Office of Diversity and Inclusion at
programcomplaints@nsf.gov
. Additionally, the UC Sexual Violence Prevention and Response is another resource, their website is
https://sexualviolence.universityofcalifornia.edu
.
Acknowledgment: This agreement is based on similar agreements by the American Mathematical Society, the Mathematical Association of America, the Encuentro Colombiano de Combinatoria (ECCO), and the Association for Women in Mathematics.
