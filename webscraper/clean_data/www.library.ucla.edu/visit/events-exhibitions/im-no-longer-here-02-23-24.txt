I’m No Longer Here
Mexico/U.S., 2019
A Cumbia beat fuels this beautifully choreographed feature by director Fernando Frías de la Parra, which ultimately is a melancholic take on emigration. In Monterrey, Mexico, Ulises is the leader of a small street gang called Los Terkos. When it becomes too dangerous for him to stay, he is forced to move to New York, where his personal style and musical preferences don’t translate. Combining style with compelling performances by non-professional actors,
I’m No Longer Here
powerfully explores the feeling of longing for home and cultural identity.
DCP, color, 106 min. Director: Fernando Frías de la Parra. Writer: Fernando Frías de la Parra. With: Juan Daniel Garcia, Jonathan Espinoza, Angelina Chen.
