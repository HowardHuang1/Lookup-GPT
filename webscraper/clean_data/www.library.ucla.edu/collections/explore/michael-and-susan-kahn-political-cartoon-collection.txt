Collection Strengths
One particular collection strength is the large number of caricatures of American presidential candidates and the elections of 1828-2020 (with the bulk of items documenting aspects of the elections between 1840 and 1908). These images are found throughout the collection illustrated in prints and on ephemera, in large colorful journal covers and small black and white drawings buried deep inside the pages.
Another collection strength is the roughly 200 unique American newspapers and magazine titles, including political cartoons. Some periodical issues in the collection are unbound (as full issues and as separated single-page magazine covers, center spreads, double-page spread illustrations and fragments of single-page illustrations), and some periodicals are bound with multiple issues as volumes.
