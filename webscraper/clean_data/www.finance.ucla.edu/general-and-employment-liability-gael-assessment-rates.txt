General and Employment Liability (GAEL) Assessment Rates
GAEL are monthly charges for General Liability (GL), General Liability Rate Additive (GLRA), Auto Liability/Auto Physical Damage & Be Smart About Safety (AL/APD BSAS), Employment Practices Liability (EPL) and Property (Prop) premiums, based on rates per $100 of payroll. These funds are used to pay for claims, purchase insurance where applicable, and other expenses associated with these programs.
Flat rates are charged for the GL RA ($0.02), AL/APD BSAS ($0.01) and Prop ($0.33) programs.
Variable rates are charged for the GLRA and EPL programs, based on claims experience and exposure.
