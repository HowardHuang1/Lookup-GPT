Records Management & Information Practices
The Records Management & Information Practices department provides three major services to the campus community: public records request processing, subpoena processing and records management consulting services.
Information Practices - Public Records Requests
The California Public Records Act declares that access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in the state, that public records are open to inspection at all times during regular office hours, and are subject to inspection and copying by every person except as noted in the Act. Certain confidentiality requirements governed by policy must be followed in order to avoid putting you and the University at risk.
Subpoena Processing
Records Management & Information Practices processes subpoenas for UCLA employment and payroll records. Other types of records requests are also processed on campus. If you are served with a subpoena or have questions pertaining to a subpoena, contact
