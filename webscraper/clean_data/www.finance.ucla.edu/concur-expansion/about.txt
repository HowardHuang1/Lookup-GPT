About the Concur Expansion
Ascend 2.0
is reimagining and modernizing UCLA’s financial landscape. As the University prepares to transition to its brand-new procurement system,
BruinBuy
Plus
, we’ll be expanding the functionality of our current Concur system.
Concur Expansion Packs
With numerous updates and enhancements on the horizon, we’re adopting a staggered deployment schedule. Our expansion packs are designed to provide maximum impact with minimal interruption, allowing you to adjust to each change before we deploy the next one.
Starting in Summer 2023
At this time, Concur is utilized for
travel and entertainment (T&E) reimbursements
, as well as
direct-billed airfare
,
lodging
, and
T&E card requests
. But it can do so much more! With the first expansion packs, the system will also handle:
Monthly PCard Statement Reconciliation
launched June 16, 2023
Non-T&E Employee/Guest Business Expense Reimbursements
launched July 10, 2023
Cash Advances
launched July 10, 2023
General Refunds
launching November 6, 2023
REMINDER:
Cash advances
are only allowed in very limited circumstances.
What Else is Coming?
We’re not just expanding Concur –
we’re improving the user and customer experience
. By consolidating reimbursements and University credit card (T&E and PCard) processes in a single system, we’re creating a one-stop shop. A few of the other benefits you can expect are streamlined support and increased inquiry transparency! Stay tuned for additional expansion pack details.
