Composite Benefit Rate Assessment
Composite Benefit Rates (CBR) at UCLA
In compliance with Federal Uniform Guidance, UCLA utilizes the CBR assessment methodology for charging fringe benefits to payroll funding sources.  Based on employee groupings, employer paid benefits are pooled and charged at a rate rather than multiple benefit charges. CBRs are designed to be charged in a consistent method as a percentage (%) to all components of pay except for certain bonuses, incentives, and Z payments.
What is included in CBR?
The following fringe benefits are included in the CBR: Retirement: Matching Retirement Contribution, UCRP Supplemental Assessment, and Faculty Summer Retirement. Taxes: OASDI, Medicare, Workers Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, UCDI Insurance, PSBP Disability, and PSBP Workers Compensation. Health & Welfare: Health Insurance Contribution, OPEB Health, Dental Insurance, Vision Insurance, Benefits Administration, Employee Support Program, Core Medical Insurance, Life Insurance, Senior Management Supplement, PSBP Broker Fee, PSBP Life Insurance, Core Life Insurance, Pay for Family Care and Bonding (PFCB), and Postdoctoral Scholars Childcare. Other benefits not mentioned above are not a part of CBR
