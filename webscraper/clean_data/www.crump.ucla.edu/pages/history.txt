History
The Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging
is named in honor of Ralph and Marjorie Crump — two of UCLA's distinguished alums — along with their children and their spouses. The Institute has benefitted from the long-term and unwavering support of this exceptional family who have provided critical funding to establish and maintain the vitality of the Institute. The photograph shows Ralph and Marjorie with their family — both from genetic lineage and by adoption of the faculty and students of the Crump Institute. Their support continues today. The Institute in 2009 moved into their new, state-of-the-art research facilities located in the California NanoSystems Institute Building (CNSI).
Graduates of the UCLA School of Engineering, Ralph and Marjorie envisioned establishing an academic research center which would bring together the field of Biomedical Engineering and the School of Medicine. What started out with a humble beginning has evolved into a vibrant and dynamic research entity that has 13 faculty members, as well as graduate students, post docs, and staff, engaged in cutting-edge research in the fields of
in vitro
and
in vivo
(imaging) molecular diagnostics, microfluidics, systems biology, and nanotechnologies. The members of the Crump faculty look forward to the years ahead as their discoveries and inventions lead to a better understanding of the biology of disease and technologies for its diagnosis and therapeutic management.
