Senior Survey
The UCLA College of Letters and Science
Reflecting on the UCLA Experience
In Spring 2023, all seniors in the UCLA College of Letters and Science were asked to complete a survey on their experiences at the university. The survey explored students’ views regarding their studies, lives on campus, and plans after graduation. Approximately 6,070 College seniors responded to the survey, representing approximately 82 percent of the graduating class.
This website features some of the main results of the survey.
Our goal is to ensure that the findings of this senior survey, and those that will follow, will help shape the UCLA experience for many generations of Bruins.
