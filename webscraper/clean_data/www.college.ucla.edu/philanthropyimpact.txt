Philanthropy Impact – UCLA College
Philanthropy: Helping to Shape the Future of UCLA College
Help UCLA College shape the future as we prepare a diverse student body for success, educate global citizens, and conduct research that changes lives. Philanthropic investment across our five divisions is vital to keep the College at the forefront of discovery, societal impact, affordable first-rate education and upward economic mobility. Fundraising priorities include:
Faculty support
: Endowed chairs ensure the College can attract leading faculty in their fields and support their pursuit of transformative research.
Graduate student support:
Graduate students fulfill a vital role conducting research and teaching undergraduates while pursuing their master’s degrees. Endowed fellowships ensure the College can compete successfully with peer institutions for the best graduate-level scholars.
Undergraduate education:
Merit- and need-based scholarships enable students to pursue enrichment opportunities such as research experience, service learning, internships and study abroad.
Programs:
We aim to provide a ‘small college’ experience within a large university through programs such as Fiat Lux seminars and writing courses run by UCLA Writing Programs. Mentoring programs such as Life Sciences Scholars support students from underrepresented backgrounds in navigating the path to careers in science and medicine.
Capital projects:
Gifts to capital projects across the College can align a donor’s name with academic and research excellence through naming opportunities, which are available for projects including Pritzker Hall (for the psychology department) and the Remote Observing Space and Planetarium (for the physics and astronomy department).
