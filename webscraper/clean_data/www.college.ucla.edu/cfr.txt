CFR – UCLA College
Corporate and Foundation Relations
The Corporate and Foundation Relations team within the UCLA College of Letters and Science exists to cultivate relationships with private foundations and corporations that result in sustainable financial support across the entire College.
In order to improve opportunities to secure funding, CFR utilizes a wide range of services and resources across campus to ensure that proposals are optimally positioned for success. We also work in coordination with a number of campus entities, including the UCLA College Office of the Deans; the UCLA Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Creative Activities, or ORCA; and the UCLA Office of Contract and Grant Administration, or OCGA.
These working relationships are key to maintaining the internal communication that is essential for upholding UCLA’s reputation of excellence with external funders. This is one of the main reasons our office encourages all UCLA College faculty and staff to contact us first when considering a private foundation or corporation for funding purposes.
