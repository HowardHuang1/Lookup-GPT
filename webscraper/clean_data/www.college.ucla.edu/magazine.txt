Celebrating a Century
When UCLA was founded in 1919, it only offered a two-year undergraduate program, with no option to receive a bachelor’s degree. In 1923, the UC Board of Regents approved expansions that transformed what was then known as the Junior College into the UCLA College of Letters and Science. In 2019, we celebrated 100 years of UCLA.
Join us for a year of celebration honoring the first century of the UCLA College.
