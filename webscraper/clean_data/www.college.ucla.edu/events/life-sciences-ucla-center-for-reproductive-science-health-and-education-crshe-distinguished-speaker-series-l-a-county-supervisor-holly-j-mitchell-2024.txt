About the event: The
UCLA Center for Reproductive Science, Health and Education (CRSHE)
is delighted to host L.A. County Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell as the inaugural distinguished speaker to discuss her work supporting healthy families and communities. As a county supervisor for the 2nd District of Los Angeles, Supervisor Mitchell champions care and support for women, girls and expecting mothers, working to ensure that their reproductive health needs are met through expanding doula care, protecting Black lives during childbirth, supporting measures for paid family leave and expanding access to abortion rights and reproductive care.
Supervisor Mitchell’s work is centered in reproductive equity and justice, key topics that the Center is keen to highlight given our vision for a future in which reproductive policies are based on rigorous science, and access to this care is more equitable. The introduction, given by UC Regent Elaine Batchlor, M.D., M.P.H., will continue on the theme of health equity and improving the lives of Black birthing persons. Dr. Batchlor serves as the CEO of MLK Community Healthcare, and has devoted her career to reducing health disparities and expanding health care quality and access for the most vulnerable.
Please join us to learn from Supervisor Mitchell and Dr. Batchlor about their work in supporting the lives of children and families in Los Angeles County and the state of California, and what they envisage for the future of reproductive health and care in our communities.
