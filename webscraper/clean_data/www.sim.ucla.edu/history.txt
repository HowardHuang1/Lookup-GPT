History of the UCLA Simulation Center
The UCLA Simulation Center was the first in Southern California to provide simulation-based training to medical students and residents.
Established in 1996 by the Department of Anesthesiology, it subsequently evolved to a joint venture between the Department of Anesthesiology and the School of Medicine. Collaborations with the School of Nursing, the School of Dentistry and the UCLA Health System has made our facility an interprofessional training center. Trainees come from UCLA and its affiliated hospitals Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, King/Drew Medical Center, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Greater Los Angeles VA Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
