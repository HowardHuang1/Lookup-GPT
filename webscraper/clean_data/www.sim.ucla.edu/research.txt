Research at the UCLA Simulation Center
The UCLA Simulation Center offers space for IRB-approved research studies. Rental fees may apply for use of spaces or equipment. In addition, the Sim Center assists researchers at the David Geffen School of Medicine and UCLA Health with projects relating to medical simulation.
We are exploring cutting-edge technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in upcoming research studies. We partner with researchers and departments who have expertise in these areas to explore applications of these emerging technologies in the training of medical students and healthcare professionals.
