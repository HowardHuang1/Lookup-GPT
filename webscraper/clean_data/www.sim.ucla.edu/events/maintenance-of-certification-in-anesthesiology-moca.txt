UCLA offers a one day simulation training course in anesthesia crisis management. Our course can be used toward the Maintenance of Certification in Anesthesiology (MOCA®). The American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) recognizes simulation as an effective approach to evaluate a physician’s teamwork and clinical skills while managing critical situations, and simulation‐based courses fulfill one of the requirements of MOCA.
To ensure learning experiences that meet the simulation requirement of MOCA, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) has established standards and endorsed simulation centers that meet those standards. The UCLA Simulation Center is a part of the
Simulation Education Network
and is an ASA endorsed simulation center, meeting all of the standards required to provide MOCA CME credit to physicians.
MOCA® and Maintenance of Certification in Anesthesiology Program® are registered trademarks of The American Board of Anesthesiology, Inc.
The David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.
The David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA designates this live activity for a maximum of
8.00
AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)™.
Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.
This activity offers up to 8.00 CME credits, of which 8.00 credits contribute to the patient safety CME component of the American Board of Anesthesiology’s redesigned Maintenance of Certification in Anesthesiology™ (MOCA®) program, known as MOCA 2.0®. Please consult the ABA website,
www.theABA.org
, for a list of all MOCA 2.0 requirements.
