Medical Student Simulation Training
The UCLA Simulation Center is a core educational unit within the Dean's Office at the
UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine
(DGSOM). Simulation is a key resource that bridges the gap between theory and clinical practice, allowing students to apply their knowledge to a hands-on experience and gain essential skills that will prepare them for their future careers as physician leaders. Simulation training is integrated within all four years of DGSOM's HEALS curriculum, offering a safe way for medical students to practice and hone key clinical skills early in their education. Simulation scenarios with facilitated debriefing provide training and coaching for effective patient care, interpersonal skills and team management.
Courses for Medical Students
Medical students train and practice at the UCLA Simulation Center on a variety of skills including:
History-taking and empathetic communication training with Standardized Patients (SPs)
Physical examination techniques with SPs
Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) with SPs
Basic Life Support certification using CPR manikins
Advanced Cardiac Life Support certification
Ultrasound training using real-world ultrasound equipment, virtual simulators, and SPs
Procedural skills training (airway, intubation, IV, suturing, etc.)
Common and acute care simulation scenarios using high fidelity simulators and SPs
