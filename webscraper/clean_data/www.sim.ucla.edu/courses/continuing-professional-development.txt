Continuing Professional Development
The
Center for Continuing Professional Development (CCPD)
at the
UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine
has been awarded accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education as a provider of continuing medical education (CME) for physicians. This accreditation ensures that the school delivers continuing education that is relevant to clinicians’ needs, evidence-based, evaluated for its effectiveness, and independent of commercial influence.
The UCLA Simulation Center supports continuing professional development with simulation-based courses for healthcare professionals in the UCLA Health System, as well as those from outside health institutions.
Continuing Medical Education (CME) and Continuing Education (CE)
We offer courses that provide both CME for physicians and Continuing Education credit for health professionals. For example, we offer simulation courses as a component of the Maintenance of Certification in Anesthesiology (MOCA), which provides up to 8.00 CME credits for physicians who complete the course. The TeamSTEPPS Master Training Course and the Simulation Instructor Course also provide Continuing Education Units (CEU) to nurses and other health professionals.
