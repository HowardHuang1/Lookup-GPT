Clinical Equipment
Real world medical equipment used to enhance realism and simulate various clinical procedures.
Clinical Equipment Overview
The UCLA Simulation Center has a variety of medical devices typically used in a real world clinical setting that can be demonstrated on our manikins or Standardized Patients during medical simulations.
They
cannot
be used in patient care because they were stated to be used solely for educational purposes per vendor purchase agreements (unless cleared by Clinical Engineering for emergency crisis use).
Requesting Clinical Equipment
Clinical equipment is available to use at our facility during on-site simulation sessions and procedural skills training. Some clinical equipment can also be rented out by members of UCLA Health, UCLA DGSOM, or affiliated groups, for on-campus non-medical use only and pending approval by our staff. An Equipment Request must be submitted for all rentals.
Educators or learners interested in renting our clinical equipment may visit the
Sim Request Portal
and fill out the form with the necessary information about your planned rental.
Clinical equipment should be requested with as much notice as possible (at least 5 business days notice preferred) to ensure the availability of the equipment. Please allow us up to 5 business days to review and respond. We cannot guarantee that same day or short notice requests will be accommodated.
