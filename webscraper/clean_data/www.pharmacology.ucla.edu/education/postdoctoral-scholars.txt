Postdoctoral Scholars
The Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology provides opportunities for postdoctoral fellows and researchers to participate in research under the guidance of the Department of Pharmacology faculty. Our research interests span a broad range of studies by integrating biological, physical, engineering and medical sciences to explore mechanisms of disease from a single cell to a whole organism level, while also encompassing patient studies. We strive to understand basic biological systems and disease states, and – where appropriate – to use these observations to develop both new molecular diagnostic technologies and new molecular therapeutics. With Pharmacology as the home department to the
Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging
and the
Ahmanson Translational Imaging Division
with its Nuclear Medicine and PET imaging research and clinical service, trainees have access to state-of-the-art science and technology to make a direct impact on patient care.
