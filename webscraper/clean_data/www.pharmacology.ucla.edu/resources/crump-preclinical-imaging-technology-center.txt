Crump Preclinical Imaging Technology Center
The
Crump Preclinical Imaging Technology Center
is a world-class center that facilitates in-vivo preclinical imaging studies for our faculty and collaborators. The Center offers state-of-the-art molecular imaging instrumentation, from digital whole body autoradiography, x-ray micro-computed tomography and micro-positron emission tomography, to bioluminescence and multispectral fluorescence imaging. It also has a fully equipped vivarium that includes a room for surgical and other experimental procedures, and access to a high performance computing infrastructure for data reconstruction, analysis and archiving. The center houses a cyclotron and radiochemistry facilities to produce PET imaging probes and support instrumentation and probe design. Dr. Shili Xu and his research team are available to help design experiments, navigate the regulatory environment and teach data analysis techniques.
