Center for SMART Health
May 2, 2016
The UCLA Center for Systematic, Measurable, Actionable, Resilient and Technology-driven Health (aka Center for SMART Health) has been formed to foster collaboration among engineers, computer scientists, clinicians, biomedical researchers, and information technologists. Formed by UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine and Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Center’s mission is to improve the quality and reliability of new health care technologies, reduce length and cost of hospital stays, and allow more patients to heal in their own homes. Researchers from the Center will also develop and test health care devices and systems—including mobile technology, big data analytics, screening technologies and medical robotics—in order to address the challenges in the way that health care is delivered.
The Center’s first project, the SMART Home Lab, is a mock residence where researchers can simulate patients’ responses to treatment and the reliability and resilience of home health sensors. The lab is located in UCLA’s Engineering VI building.
Our special congratulations to the Center’s two co-directors: Majid Sarrafzadeh, professor of computer science and electrical engineering and co-founder of UCLA’s Wireless Health Institute, and Dr. Arash Naeim, associate professor of medicine and Geffen School’s chief medical officer for clinical research. Both Sarrafzadeh and Naeim are also members of the UCLA B. John Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences.
