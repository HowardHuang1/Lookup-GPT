Graduate Student Welfare
Earning a graduate degree is both rewarding and challenging.  Along the way there can be bumps in the road, personally and professionally.  When those things happen, we have a variety of resources to help.
* The Vice Chair for Graduate Studies (Miryung Kim,
miryung@cs.ucla.edu
) and the Director of Graduate Student Affairs Officer (Helen Tran,
helen@cs.ucla.edu
) are available to provide advice and assistance for any issues related to your ability to make progress toward the degree.  They also specifically provide assistance to students who are in-between advisors or considering switching advisors, including help with continued funding for Ph.D. students during the transition period.
* The CS department has a Graduate Student Welfare Committee consisting of faculty who have volunteered to be available for students who need advice or assistance, and you can feel free to contact any one of them.  Currently the committee members are Todd Millstein (

odd@cs.ucla.edu
), Amit Sahai (
sahai@cs.ucla.edu
) and Yizhou Sun (
yzsun@cs.ucla.edu
).
*
UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS
)
provides confidential mental health care and resources for all registered students, including individual and/or group treatment, urgent services and referrals when needed.

provides a safe place for survivors of sexual violence to get confidential support.
