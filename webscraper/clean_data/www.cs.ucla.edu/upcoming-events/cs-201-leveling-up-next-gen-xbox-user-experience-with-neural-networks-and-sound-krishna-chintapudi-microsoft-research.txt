ABSTRACT:
This talk presents two groundbreaking innovations in enhancing the gaming experience on Next-Gen Xbox platforms – ADR-X (NSDI 2024) and Ekho (SIGCOMM 2023). ADR-X, is a neural network-assisted wireless link rate adaptation technique for compute-constrained embedded gaming devices. It uses a meticulously crafted NN based contextual bandit that leverages existing communication theory domain knowledge. This allows ADR-X to perform at par with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques such as PPO while also running 100x faster. Ekho introduces a novel approach to synchronizing cloud gaming media over the internet – crucial for immersive gameplay. By embedding faint, human-inaudible pseudo-noise markers into game audio and detecting them through player microphones, Ekho accurately measures and compensates for inter-stream delays.
