UCLA South Bay Campus Locations
In 2022, UCLA acquired two properties (formerly the Marymount California University) to create it's new UCLA South Bay Campus. UCLA South Bay consists of a 24.5-acre main campus high on a bluff in Rancho Palos Verdes and an 11-acre residential townhouse site in San Pedro. The UCLA Events Office is happy to offer these locations for production locations, subject to availability.
