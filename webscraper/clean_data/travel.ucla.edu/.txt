Reconciling Company Card Transactions
Travel & Entertainment Card
Use of the Travel & Entertainment (T&E) Card is limited to business travel and event expenses that will be paid directly from the University to US Bank via expense report. The T&E Card should not be used for other types of business expenses and should never be used for personal charges of any kind.
All T&E Card transactions must now be accounted for in the new Express. A cardholder can no longer use the T&E Card, pay US Bank directly (out of pocket), then remove the transaction like they could in the legacy Express.
To account for a T&E Card transaction that the cardholder personally paid to the bank, the transaction must be attached to an expense report and assigned to the “Personal Expense” expense type. Selecting Personal Expense indicates that no payment should be made from the University to US Bank. Selecting Personal Expense for a T&E Card transaction does not necessarily mean that the expense was not for business, but it accounts for the transaction without sending a payment to the bank.
Please note that an expense report cannot be submitted if the only line items on the report are all Personal Expenses (the user will see a red “Action Required” exception message). Personal Expense transactions should be attached to a report in a timely manner, but the report should be held until there are other valid business expenses ready to submit. The Personal Expenses would be combined on the same expense report as the next available business expenses. The trip/event for the next valid business expenses is what the header information (purpose, destination, justification, date range) should be updated to. Be advised that the cardholder (and any delegates who have permission to receive their emails) will continue to receive periodic email reminders until this is resolved by submitting a valid report.
Direct Billed Airfare
Airfare and UCTC service fee charges that are paid via direct billing are also now reconciled via Express. Users will see these company card transactions along with their T&E Card transactions when completing an expense report. To account for these direct bill charges, the company card transaction(s) must be added to an expense report and an approved request must be linked. The transactions can be added to the report as soon as they are available, but the report should not be submitted until after completion of the trip. Any out of pocket or T&E Card transactions should included on the same report, to provide a full accounting of the trip or event.
Please refer to the Quick Reference Guides for detailed Instructions on how to create a report from a request and how to attach company card transactions.

Submitting a Request for a Ticket Refund
The UC Travel Center (UCTC) will advise you if your ticket may qualify for a refund. Refunds are not guaranteed, and airlines may change their refund policy at any time without notification.
If your ticket may qualify for a refund, you will need to create a Request to cover the applicable airline and UCTC service fees.
Specific instructions for how to format a refund request are available here:

Revised Travel Guidelines for Meetings, Meals & Events
The COVID-19 Response and Recovery Task Force has developed new UCLA protocols for planned gathering as we continue to acclimate back to in-person teaching, learning, living and working. These temporary protocols are effective Monday, October 4, 2021 and planned to be
in place until Wednesday, December 1, 2021.
Meetings, Meals, and Events
Generally, food at indoor events and meetings is not permitted, with exceptions for restaurants, dining halls and conference facilities that have other mitigations in place. Vaccination or recent negative test verification is necessary for all indoor and outdoor events. Please see the protocol document for specific details. Although we plan to have these protocols in place until Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021, UCLA will continue to monitor campus and area case levels, and make changes and adjustments as needed to support the continued safety of our UCLA community and others who attend our events.
UCLA Indoor/Outdoor Organized Event Temporary Protocols Recommendation (PDF)﻿
Travel
The guidelines for travel
remain the same
as in the June 7 BruinPost and are as follows:
UCLA has been following public health guidance with regard to non-essential travel. Following
CDC travel guidance
changes, LACDPH has also modified their guidance to reflect that COVID-19 vaccines are readily available. Employees who are vaccinated may undertake non-essential travel, while such travel is still discouraged for unvaccinated individuals. UCLA employees must follow the
LACDPH travel guidelines
and corresponding mitigation measures, including mask wearing for all travelers and for those who are unvaccinated, testing before and after certain types of travel, as well as quarantining after returning from out-of-state travel. Managers and travelers should consider the impact of quarantine requirements at the destination location for work-related travel plans. Please note that travel no longer requires approval from a Dean, Vice Chancellor or Vice Provost, as has been required since last March.
If you have questions related to the above guidance, please contact Travel Accounting at
travelacct@finance.ucla.edu
