Laurel and Hardy Film Preservation Fund
Perfect Day
(1929)
One of the ironies of film preservation is that it's often the most popular titles that are most in need of restoration, and this is certainly true of the work of the beloved comic duo, Laurel and Hardy, whose films have been used, reused and overused to the point of severe attrition. The Archive kicked off a major preservation effort to restore all of its surviving negatives of Laurel and Hardy.  Thanks to the generosity of Mr. Jeff Joseph, a major lead gift has been pledged for the project.
Donate to the Laurel and Hardy Preservation Fund
and know that you are contributing to the preservation of their work for generations to come.
