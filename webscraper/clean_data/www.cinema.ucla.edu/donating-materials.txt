Donation
UCLA Film & Television Archive welcomes donations of film and video. As the University is a non-profit institution, donations are tax-deductible. All material donated to the Archive becomes the physical property of the University. The Archive will then safeguard this material for posterity, ensuring that it can be enjoyed for generations to come.
Donation with copyright
Provided that the donor is the copyright holder, he or she can also donate the rights to UCLA. When rights are donated, the Archive can provide the greatest amount of public access to the footage. The Archive can screen the work and reproduce the footage for preservation purposes without restriction.
Deposit
A deposit is essentially a permanent loan. The depositor retains ownership of the physical property and can have access to the deposited items from time to time, after which they are to be returned to the Archive. Items placed on deposit will be used for research and study on the UCLA campus and possibly exhibited at the Archive’s screening venue.
A deposit can be turned into a donation at any time.  A deposit is not tax-deductible.
