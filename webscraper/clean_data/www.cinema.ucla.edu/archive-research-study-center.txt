UCLA Powell Library
Serving the UCLA community and an international constituency of academic faculty, scholars, students, writers, and professionals, the Archive Research and Study Center (ARSC) provides a vital access point to UCLA Film & Television Archive's collection of over 350,000
films and television programs
, over 100,000
News and Public Affairs (NAPA)
programs, and over 2,000 radio programs. ARSC coordinates individual viewing appointments, facilitating access to the Archive's rare collections through the Powell Library Media Lab at UCLA. With ARSC's assistance, visitors conduct scholarly and professional research for hundreds of class assignments, dissertations, publications and film and television productions.
Coordinate a Research Visit
Many of UCLA Film & Television Archive's holdings can be viewed for research purposes in the Powell Library Media Lab (Room 270).
All research visits and viewing requests must be coordinated in advance with ARSC
. We do not collect books, periodicals, production files, scripts, photographs, or information about material in our collection.
While some holdings can be made available for appointment viewing with short lead time, a significant portion of the collection may require up to two weeks or longer to be made accessible for viewing.
As the first step in arranging a visit, please
search Collections
to locate titles of interest.
From researching our holdings in the
UC Library Search
catalog, we ask that you please compile your viewing request list and email it to us, noting item inventory numbers and titles as listed in the catalog.
Upon receipt of your requests from the catalog, ARSC staff will advise on the availability of specific titles, make recommendations for additional materials of interest, and assist in selecting appropriate visit dates for your appointments.
Please review our
Research FAQ
before planning any travel to conduct research at ARSC.
