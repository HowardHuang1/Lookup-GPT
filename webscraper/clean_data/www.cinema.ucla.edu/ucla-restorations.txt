The Toll of the Sea
(1922)
Since 1977, UCLA Film & Television Archive has restored hundreds of titles, including silent films (
Different from the Others
, 1919), technological milestones (
Becky Sharp
, 1935), beloved classics (
The Red Shoes
,
1948) and independent works of American cinema (
Killer of Sheep
, 1977). Since 1987, more than 500 television programs have been restored.
Our restored materials are regularly broadcast, screened at film festivals, museums and cinematheques, and used for top-tier DVD/Blu-ray releases from major studios or speciality labels like the Criterion Collection, Milestone Films and the National Film Preservation Foundation's
Treasures from American Film Archives
series.
Under the terms of the National Film Preservation Act, each year the Library of Congress names 25 films to the National Film Registry that are "culturally, historically or aesthetically" significant. The
2013
,
2014
and
2015
National Film Registries have included titles restored by the Archive.
