About the Archive
Film vaults at the PHI Stoa, Santa Clarita
The UCLA Film & Television Archive is renowned for its pioneering efforts to rescue, preserve and showcase moving image media, and is dedicated to ensuring that the collective visual memory of our time is explored and enjoyed for generations to come. Established in 1965, the Archive is the second-largest repository of motion pictures and broadcast programming in the United States, after the Library of Congress, and the world's largest university-held collection. More than 520,000 holdings of films, television programs, news footage and radio recordings are conserved in a state-of-the-art facility, called the PHI Stoa, in Santa Clarita, California.
We are committed to the
collection
,
preservation and restoration
, and
exhibition
of moving images. The Archive's public programs take place year-round at the
Billy Wilder Theater
at the Hammer Museum in Westwood Village, Los Angeles. The Archive
loans media
from its vast collection to cinematheques and film festivals around the world. Additionally, footage licensed from the Archive has appeared in many
notable projects
for the big screen, television and more. Many items in the Archive's collection can be accessed for research by appointment through the
Archive Research and Study Center
at UCLA.
The Archive is a unit of the
UCLA Library
, one of the country's leading academic libraries in research, groundbreaking discoveries and innovation.
