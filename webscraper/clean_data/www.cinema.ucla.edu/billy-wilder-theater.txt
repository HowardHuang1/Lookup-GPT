About the Theater
The theater's modern design by Michael Maltzan Architecture stylishly interprets cinema's play of light and movement in real space, and the 295-seat interior features comfortable leather seats with superb sightlines. The theater is made possible by a generous gift from Audrey L. Wilder and named in honor of Mrs. Wilder's late husband, the legendary screenwriter, director and producer. Born on the outskirts of the Austro-Hungarian empire, Billy Wilder fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s to become a master of Hollywood film language and a shrewd comic observer of the American scene. Among the many classics Wilder co-wrote and directed were
Double Indemnity
(1944),
Sunset Boulevard
(1950) and
Some Like It Hot
(1959).
Conveniently located in the Hammer Museum on the corner of Westwood and Wilshire Boulevards, the theater offers visitors the chance to plan their evenings with
