The UCLA Film & Television Archive exists to not only preserve the rich cultural heritage captured by moving images, but also to celebrate it and move knowledge forward. As one of the world’s largest collections of film and television, we take our responsibility to safeguard this moving image heritage seriously. We are proud that our supporters do as well.
The Archive is many things to many people. Whether you enjoy our public programs, appreciate our preservation efforts or the fact that our collections are accessible to students, scholars, researchers and others for free through the Archive Research and Study Center, the Archive exists to serve the diverse cultural interests and educational needs of our community. We would not be able to fulfill our mission without the support of donors.
