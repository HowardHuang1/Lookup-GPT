Logos and Marks
Caught up in the size and complexity of UCLA and the excitement of new research and academic programs, it's tempting to create and use "custom" logos. But the UCLA story is best told within a consistent framework, including disciplined use of logos and marks. UCLA's logos and marks are valuable institutional assets, protected both by law and policy. This section provides a guide to the basic graphics and their proper usage.
Campus Logo
The UCLA Campus Logo is the core graphic used to identify our institution, its administrative and academic units, programs, and initiatives. The Campus Logo should always be used to represent UCLA as an academic enterprise.
Department Logos
School and department logos are created by UCLA Marketing as part of a system combining the campus logo with the name of the school or department.
Script Logo
The UCLA Script Logo is used by the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics and appears on team uniforms and sportswear. Use is restricted.
Seals
The UCLA Campus Seal and the University Seal are used primarily for formal and ceremonial purposes. Use is restricted.
Historical Marks
Over the years, illustrations of campus mascots and other graphics have been adopted for specific uses. These historical logos and marks are protected by law and policy. Use is restricted.
