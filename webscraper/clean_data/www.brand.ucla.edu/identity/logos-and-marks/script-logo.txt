Logos and Marks
Script Logo
The traditional Script Logo dates to the 1920s; the current iteration was adopted in July 2017. UCLA Policy 110 distinguishes between the Campus Logo, used to represent the institution, and the Script Logo, used primarily to represent intercollegiate athletics. This is a common distinction at major universities. Harvard University, Stanford University and Ohio State University, among others, use separate institutional and athletic logos.
The script logo is not available for download because its use is restricted. Script logo artwork is available through UCLA Trademarks and Licensing but reserved for use for the following groups only: UCLA Athletics, UCLA Spirit Squad, UCLA Bruin Marching Band and UCLA Recreation. To request permission, go to

.
