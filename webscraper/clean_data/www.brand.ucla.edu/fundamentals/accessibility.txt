Accessibility
Part of being a public university is being inclusive: to fully include everyone who engages with us. Therefore, accessibility isn’t optional. It’s a mandatory mindset and practice for everyone working on UCLA communications.
We are committed to accessibility out of respect for the rights and dignity of others, as stated in our
True Bruin Values
.
As a public institution, we receive federal, state and local funding. That means both
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
(1973) and the
Americans with Disabilities Act
(1990) apply to our campus. The University of California has established a systemwide policy, known as the
UC Information Technology Accessibility Policy
.
Want to learn more about accessibility and why it matters? We recommend this
accessibility video series
produced by UCLA’s Disabilities Computing Program.
Accessibility Guidelines
As communication trends and platforms continue to evolve, we must be mindful of accessibility across the entire range of media. The choices we make, such as colors and fonts, are not simply aesthetic decisions; they are important to usability.
