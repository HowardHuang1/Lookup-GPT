Research Posters
Use these standardized templates and guidelines to create professional presentations representing UCLA, your department or your research work.
Presentation Templates
These templates provide options for designing presentations using either PowerPoint or InDesign. When creating your presentation, think of each slide as a kind of billboard, with simple, direct communication. Concise slides are generally more effective than slides overloaded with text. Feature photos or clean, simple charts to relay information or embedded videos and infographics to illustrate aspects of your presentation.

Research Posters
A research poster should tell the story of your research in an organized, concise manner that engages the reader. The poster usually contains text and graphics. You also want your poster to be self-explanatory so anyone viewing it can easily understand the project. It is important the poster be easy to read for multiple people looking at it from a few feet away.
