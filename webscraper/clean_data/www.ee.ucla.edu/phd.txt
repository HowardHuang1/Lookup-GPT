Samueli Electrical and Computer Engineering
Ph.D. Program Overview
The Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering is a research-oriented degree allowing students to specialize in a subfield of the discipline and participate in the discovery of new ideas.  The doctoral program allows ample opportunities for interdisciplinary research and collaboration across multiple departments.
Ph.D. students must meet several milestones, which culminate in a doctoral dissertation.
Our Department requires that all doctoral students hold an M.S. degree.  Although students are not required to hold an M.S. degree at the time of admission, they must complete an M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, or a related field, before beginning their Ph.D. program requirements. Ph.D. students admitted without holding an M.S. degree are required to devote the first two years of their graduate program to the completion of this degree.
The major milestones for the Ph.D. program are listed below:
Fulfillment of M.S. degree requirements (if applicable)
A successful outcome in Ph.D. Preliminary Examination
Completion of Ph.D. course requirements
Nomination of a doctoral committee
Passing the Ph.D. Oral Qualifying Examination
Completion of doctoral research
Writing of the dissertation
Successful defense of the dissertation (the Final Oral Examination)
Submission of the Dissertation
All Ph.D. requirements must be completed within five (5) academic years. Students admitted to the Ph.D. program without an M.S. degree will receive an additional two (2) academic years to complete the M.S. degree requirements.  Additionally, Ph.D. students must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5 throughout the duration of the Ph.D. program.
