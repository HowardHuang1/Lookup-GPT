Samueli Electrical and Computer Engineering
B.S. Program Overview
The electrical engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,
www.abet.org
. The accredited curriculum provides an excellent background for either graduate study or employment. The education and research activities in the department are strongly aligned with the department’s mission and program educational objectives.
Undergraduate education in the UCLA Electrical and Computer Engineering Department provides:
Fundamental knowledge in mathematics, physical sciences, Electrical and Comput engineering.
Opportunities to specialize in specific areas of interest or career aspirations.
Intensive training in problem solving, laboratory skills, and design skills.
A well-rounded education that includes communication skills, the ability to function well on an interdisciplinary and multi-cultural team, an appreciation for ethical behavior, and the ability to engage in lifelong learning.
Electrical Engineering B.S.
The undergraduate curriculum provides all Electrical Engineering majors with preparation in the mathematical and scientific disciplines that lead to a set of courses that span the fundamentals of the three major departmental areas of signals and systems, circuits and embedded systems, and physical wave electronics. These collectively provide an understanding of inventions of importance to society, such as integrated circuits, embedded systems, photonic devices, automatic computation and control, and telecommunication devices and systems.
Students are encouraged to make use of their electrical and computer engineering electives and a two-term capstone design course to pursue deeper knowledge within one of these areas according to their interests, whether for graduate study or preparation for employment.

prerequisites
:

GE Requirement
web page.
Suggested Tracks
The technical breadth area requirement provides an opportunity to combine elective courses in the Electrical Engineering major with those from another UCLA Samueli major to produce a specialization in an interdisciplinary domain. Students are free to design a specialization in consultation with a faculty adviser.
Bioengineering and Informatics (BI)
refers to the design of biomedical devices and the analysis of data derived from such devices and instruments. Students might take Chemistry and Biochemistry 20B and two courses from Bioengineering 100, C101, C102, and 110 and/or 12 units from Computer Science CM121, Electrical and Computer Engineering 114, 133B, 134, and 176 and 8 capstone design units from 180DA/180DB.
Computer Engineering (CE)
concentrates on the part of the hardware/software stack related to the design of new processors and the operation of embedded systems. Students might take a 12unit technical breadth area in computer science such as Computer Science 111, 117, 130, and 180 and/or 12 units of electives from Electrical and Computer Engineering 115C, M116C, M116L, M119, 132B, and M146 and 8 capstone design units from 113DA/113DB or 180DA/180DB or 183DA/183DB.

Computer Engineering B.S.
The undergraduate curriculum provides all computer engineering students with preparation in the mathematical and scientific disciplines that lead to a set of courses that span the fundamentals of the discipline in the major areas of data science and embedded networked systems. These collectively provide an understanding of many inventions of importance to our society, such as the Internet of Things, human-cyber-physical systems, mobile/wearable/implantable systems, robotic systems, and more generally smart systems at all scales in diverse spheres. The design of hardware, software, and algorithmic elements of such systems represents an already dominant and rapidly growing part of the computer engineering profession. Students are encouraged to make use of their computer science and electrical and computer engineering electives and a two-quarter capstone design course to pursue deeper knowledge within one of these areas according to their interests, whether for graduate study or preparation for employment.
Major Courses
In order to prepare for the major, students must take the following
prerequisites
:
Computer Science 1 (or Electrical and Computer Engineering 1), 31, 32, 33, 35L, M51A (or Electrical and Computer Engineering M16)
Electrical and Computer Engineering 3
Engineering 96C
Mathematics 31A, 31B, 32A, 32B, 33A, 33B, 61
Physics 1A, 1B, 1C, and 4AL or 4BL
The Computer Engineering B.S. consists of the following courses:
Computer Science 111, 118 (or Electrical and Computer Engineering 132B), M151B (or Electrical and Computer Engineering M116C), M152A (or Electrical and Computer Engineering M116L), 180
Electrical and Computer Engineering 100, 102, 113, 115C
One course from Civil and Environmental Engineering 110, Electrical and Computer Engineering 131A, Mathematics 170A, 170E, Statistics 100A
8 units of computer science and 8 units of electrical and computer engineering upper-division electives
Three technical breadth courses (12 units) selected from an approved list available in the Office of Academic and Student Affairs
8 units capstone design from either Electrical and Computer Engineering 180DA/180DB or 183DA/183DB

GE Requirement
web page.
Suggested Tracks
Networked Embedded Systems
: This track targets two related trends that have been a significant driver of computing, namely standalone embedded devices becoming networked and coupled to physical systems, and the Internet evolving toward a network of things (the IoT). These may broadly be classified as cyber-physical systems, and includes a broad category of systems such as smart buildings, autonomous vehicles, and robots, which interact with each other and other systems. This trend in turn is driving innovation both in the network technologies (new low-power wireless networks for connecting things, and new High-speed networks and computing infrastructure to accommodate the transport and processing needs of the deluge of data resulting from continual sensing), and in embedded computing (new hardware and software stack catering to requirements such as ultralow power operation, and embedded machine learning).
Students pursuing this track are strongly encouraged to take Electrical and Computer Engineering M119 or Computer Science M119 in junior year, and to choose three electives from courses such as Computer Science 117, 130, 131, 132, 133, 136, 181, 188, Electrical and Computer Engineering 2, 115A, 115B, 132A, 133A, 141, 142, 188.
Students who pursue a technical breadth area in either electrical and computer engineering or computer science can choose an additional three courses from this list.
Data Science
: This track targets the trend toward the disruptive impact on computing systems, both at the edge and in the cloud, of massive amounts of sensory data being collected, shared, processed, and used for decision making and control. Application domains such as health, transportation, energy, etc. are being transformed by the abilities of inference-making and decision-making from sensory data that is pervasive, continual, and rich. This track will expose students to the entire data-to-decision pathway spanning the entire stack from hardware and software to algorithms, applications, and user experience.
Students pursing this track are strongly advised to take Computer Science 143 and M146 or Electrical and Computer Engineering M146, and to additionally choose two electives from courses such as Computer Science CM121, 136, 144, 145, 161, 188, Electrical and Computer Engineering 114, 133A, 133B, 134, 188.
Students who pursue a technical breadth area in either electrical and computer engineering or computer science can choose an additional three courses from this list.
Students are also free to design ad hoc tracks. The technical breadth area requirement provides an opportunity to combine elective courses in electrical and computer engineering and computer science with those from another UCLA Samueli major to produce a specialization in an interdisciplinary domain. As noted above, students can also select a technical breadth area in either Electrical and Computer Engineering or Computer Science to deepen their knowledge in either discipline.
