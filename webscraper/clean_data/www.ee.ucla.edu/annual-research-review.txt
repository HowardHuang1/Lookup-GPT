Virtual Research Review
UCLA’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Annual Research Review has now launched in its virtual format, namely “VRR”.   There are many recorded video talks by the students — some linked to and/or accompanied by published papers/posters — that will be rolled out here on the website on a regular basis for you to view at your convenience. The Department will send out monthly notifications about the scheduled talks, and the webpage will also be updated from time to time to identify future scheduled presentations.  This virtual event will continue to showcase our Department’s research and continues to offer opportunities for interactions with academic and industry researchers. We are excited to launch this VRR and gratefully acknowledge the continued support of our sponsors for this event.
