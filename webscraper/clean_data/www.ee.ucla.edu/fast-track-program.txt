About the Program
In Fall 2015, the UCLA Electrical Engineering Department (now Electrical and Computer Engineering) inaugurated the Fast Track to Success program for incoming undergraduate students. The main purpose of this program is to recruit a pool of highly talented high school students and provide them with a supportive environment and opportunities so that they can challenge themselves to succeed in their future careers as engineers in industry, academia and entrepreneurship.
The students are expected to maintain an accumulated GPA of at least 3.3 and take at least 30 units worth of honors/advanced standing classes during their four years at UCLA. These students will also be considered for summer internships, starting in their freshman year, with faculty members in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and present their work in a special forum at the end of the summer.
