Samueli Electrical and Computer Engineering
UCLA Electrical and Computer Engineering At-A-Glance
The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department is one of seven academic departments in the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS). The Department is administratively divided into three research areas: Circuits & Embedded Systems, Physical & Wave Electronics, and Signals & Systems; although much of our research is multi-disciplinary and features collaborations in various fields including medicine, physics, mathematics, and theater & film.
The core leadership of the Department is led by the Department Chair, four Vice Chairs (Undergraduate Affairs, Graduate Affairs, Industrial Relations & Computer Engineering) and three Area Directors (one for each of the research areas noted above). The faculty consists of 48 ladder faculty, 15 courtesy/joint faculty, 4 adjunct faculty, 15 emeriti faculty and 9 lecturers.
