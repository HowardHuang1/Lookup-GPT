UCLA CHIPS and SEMI Release Manufacturing Roadmap for Heterogeneous Integration and Electronics Packaging (MRHIEP) Report
The Center for Heterogeneous Integration and Performance Scaling at UCLA (UCLA CHIPS) and SEMI, a leading industry association that aims to advance the global semiconductor supply chain, released a multi-institutional report on December 6, 2023 at the UCLA CHIPS biannual workshop. The report’s principal investigators are Subramanian Iyer, a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, who has been on assignment to the CHIPS for America Office since late September 2023; and Gity Samadi, director of R&D Programs at SEMI.
The MRHIEP Report
is a quick start guide for onshore advanced packaging in the U.S. It represents the combined effort of approximately 100 industry veterans representing more than 40 companies, academic institutions, industrial consortia and government agencies. The report is based on
the Heterogeneous Integration Roadmap
(HIR) and adds a manufacturing approach to implement the HIR. UCLA Samueli electrical and computer engineering assistant professor Nader Sehatbakhsh and Ph.D. student Krutikesh Sahoo are section leads from UCLA CHIPS.
