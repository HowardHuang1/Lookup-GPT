Industry Events
Electrical & Computer Engineering “Virtual” Career Fair hosted by HKN – October 2020

The “Afternoon with Industry” was held on Thursday, May 2, 2019 followed by the Electrical and Computer Engineering 2019 Annual Research Review (ARR) on Friday, May 3, 2019. These events showcased our Department’s research, including students’ presentations and posters, distinguished plenary speakers, and offered opportunities for interactions with academic and industry researchers.
As in previous years, we had a great turn-out with excellent participation and feedback from our Industry guests. We gratefully acknowledge the support of our sponsors for this event, and we look forward to seeing you all next year.
