Passed/Not Passed (P/NP) Eligibility
Required courses (e.g. math, science, prep for the major, major courses, major electives, technical breadth, Engl Comp 3, ethics, etc.)  for all UCLA Samueli School of Engineering majors and minors must be taken for a letter grade (unless the course is graded P/NP only)
.
If an engineering course is designated LG this means students do not have the PNP option regardless of major.
For engineering students: ONLY courses that are PNP ONLY or General Education (GE) or excess units (not required courses) AND
also have the Student  Option (SO) grade designation (Listed in the Schedule of Classes as may be taken for Letter grade or Pass/Not Pass) may be taken for P/NP if the student is in good academic standing.
In addition to the above, further restrictions on taking a course P.NP are:
A) an engineering student can enroll in courses that are P/NP grading  only up to four units in one quarter without any additional UCLA Samueli School of Engineering restrictions or requirements.  A student who has not elected the P/NP option, if eligible, in the immediate previous term (last regular term enrolled (excludes summer)
may petition
to take two grading optional courses (maximum 10 units) P/NP.
B) For courses that are grading optional (letter grade OR P/NP), students are allowed to enroll in one grading option course (up to 5 units) under P/NP in a quarter if they are:
are in good academic standing (2.0 or higher term and cumulative GPA) and
have not received two NP grades. Students who have received two NP grades shall be excluded from electing courses on a P/NP basis for one quarter and
are not repeating a course in which a grade of C-, D+, D, D- or F has been earned. Courses in which a letter grade is received may NOT be repeated on a P/NP  basis.
Courses originally taken on a P/NP  basis may be repeated on the same basis or for a letter grade.
C) During Summer Sessions, for GE courses that are grading optional (letter grade OR P/NP), students are allowed to enroll in one grading option course (up to 5 units) under P/NP if they
are:
are in good academic standing (2.0 or higher term and cumulative GPA) and
have not received two NP grades. Students who have received two NP grades shall be excluded from electing courses on a P/NP basis for one quarter and
are not repeating a course in which a grade of C-, D+, D, D- or F has been earned.  Courses in which a letter grade is received may NOT be repeated on a P/NP  basis.
Courses originally taken on a P/NP  basis may be repeated on the same basis or for a letter grade.
Passed/Not Passed and Equivalent Letter Grades
In order to receive a Passed “P” grade, you must achieve a grade of
C or better.
Work done at the level of C- or below will be given a Not Passed “NP” and you will earn no units toward graduation.
Exceptions
All petitions for exceptions to enrollment rules or for changes to study lists after the deadlines must be submitted through Message Center to the Office of Academic and Student Affairs as detailed at t
he OASA petition website
. IF approved, the student must file the enrollment petition with the Registrar. The student’s BAR account will be charged for any fee. For other exceptions see a UCLA Samueli School of Engineering academic counselor.
COURSE PLANNING
TRANSFER CREDIT for continuing students
For students who entered UCLA in
Fall 2017 or later
:  After completing 105 lower-division quarter units toward the degree in all institutions attended, students are allowed no further unit credit for courses completed at a community college or for lower-division courses completed at any institution outside of the University of California. The University of California does not grant transfer credit for community college or lower-division courses beyond 105 quarter units, but students may still receive subject credit for this coursework to satisfy lower-division requirements subject to course evaluation approval (students can meet with an OASA academic counselor to see if they meet eligibility). Be sure to submit the course evaluation form to determine equivalence before taking the course.
Units earned through Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and/or A-Level examinations are not included in the limitation. Units earned at any UC campus (through extension, summer, cross-campus, UCEAP, Intercampus Visitor Program, and regular academic year enrollment) are not included in the limitation. To convert semester units into quarter units, multiply the semester units by 1.5; for example, 12 semester units x 1.5 = 18 quarter units. To convert quarter units into semester units, multiply the quarter units by .666; for example, 12 quarter units x .666 = 7.99 or 8 semester units.
For students who entered UCLA
before Fall 2017
: Continuing UCLA Samueli School of Engineering students who have completed 105 or more units from any source may not earn additional credit from any community college. Credit may be granted for work completed at 4-year institutions; however, UCLA prohibits concurrent enrollment, and students who take courses at other schools during a term in which they are also enrolled at UCLA will not get credit for the work completed at the other school.
For credit to be applied to UCLA Samueli School of Engineering degree requirements, students must
submit transcripts
and
evaluation materials
no later than the end of the first term at UCLA after completing the work.
University Requirements and English Composition 3
Students must work toward satisfaction of either the Entry Level Writing or English as a Second Language (ESL) requirement during their first quarter in residence and subsequent quarters if necessary. English Composition 3 must be completed before the end of the second year of enrollment. A grade of C or better must be earned in the required English course(s). These courses may not be taken P/NP. The American History and Institutions requirement must be satisfied in order to graduate. Please refer to the UCLA General Catalog for details.
Repetition of Courses
Courses taken at the University MAY BE repeated at UCLA only subject to the following:
Student received a grade of C- or lower in the course or a NP
Course may not be repeated more than once without the approval of the Associate Dean through
the OASA petition process
For undergraduates who repeat a total of 16 units or less, only the most recently earned letter grades and grade points will be computed into the grade-point average; however, all grades will remain on student’s transcript.  After repeating 16 units, the GPA will be based on all letter grades assigned and total units attempted.
See the
OASA FAQ for additional details on repetition of courses
.
Grade of Incomplete
IF YOU RECEIVE A GRADE OF I DO NOT RE-ENROLL IN THE COURSE
Incomplete Grades
The instructor may assign the incomplete (I) grade under the following conditions: the student must ask the Instructor for the I grade, the student’s work must be of passing quality and the reasons for requesting the I grade must be of sufficient gravity to warrant an incomplete grade (such as illness or other serious problem). It is the student’s responsibility to discuss with the instructor the possibility of receiving an I grade as opposed to a non passing grade.
However, a professor may certainly reach out to a student and suggest an incomplete if they feel the situation is appropriate.
How do these rules apply to students who miss a final exam?  If a student does not take the final exam and never contacts the instructor, the student receives the grade they have earned with their completed work up to that point, usually an F.  Consistent with the above discussion, if a student contacts the instructor providing a   valid and documented reason (e.g. illness), the student will receive an incomplete (I), if and only if the student has a passing grade (C- or higher) at that point.  Again, a professor may reach out to a student who misses a final if they feel it is appropriate.  If an incomplete is given, the student must make arrangements with the instructor to take the final exam the following quarter.
If an I grade is assigned, students may receive unit credit and grade points by satisfactorily completing the coursework as specified by the instructor. Students should not re-enroll in the course; if they do, it is recorded twice on the transcript. If the work is not completed by the end of the next full term in residence, the I grade lapses to an F, NP, or U as appropriate. The College or school may extend the deadline in unusual cases (not applicable to graduate students). Once an Incomplete (I) grade is assigned, it remains on the transcript along with the passing grade students may later receive for the course.
Graduate Level Courses (Courses numbered 200 and above).
UCLA Samueli School of Engineering undergraduate students are not allowed to enroll in graduate level courses without first obtaining approval
by petition to Message Cente
r.  Students  must meet course requisites and have at minimum a 3.0 GPA for approval consideration.
Degree Check, DARS report and DPR
The  degree check is the official record of how all UC and transfer credit has been applied to your requirements.
DARS (Degree Audit Reporting System) is a computerized degree audit system
.  Students who use DARS will be able to see the credit they have received and determine which requirements of their degree are left to complete. Keep in mind that this is a tentative audit only.  The DPR was designed for L&S College students and shows the Admission’s Office evaluation of transfer credit, NOT the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering evaluation which gives more useable credit because, unlike the DPR, it reflects your major requirements.
