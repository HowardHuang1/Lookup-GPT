General Education (GE) courses introduce fundamental ideas in arts, humanities, social sciences, and science and challenge students to assess information critically; frame and deliver reasoned and persuasive arguments orally and in writing; and identify, acquire, and use the knowledge necessary to solve problems.
GEs are grouped into three foundational areas:
Arts and Humanities, Society and Culture, and Scientific Inquiry, with subcategories in each group.
*Courses listed in more than one category can fulfill GE requirements in only one of the cross-listed categories.
