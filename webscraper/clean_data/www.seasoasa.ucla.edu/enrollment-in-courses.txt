Note for Non-Engineering Students
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY
: We will not be offering ENGR 95 or 195 opportunities to students in majors outside of the Samueli School of Engineering, unless your internship is specifically Engineering or Computer Science related. The College has informed us that the proper procedure is to reach out to the
Center for Community Engagement

Lab Safety Training is REQUIRED!  Click for details.
Lab Safety Training must be completed BEFORE Beginning Research (Students are advised to sign up for training well in advance of enrollment deadlines – Students are now REQUIRED to submit a copy of
their lab training certificates when submitting contracts to enroll in 99, 196, 198, 199 research in engineering, medicine, life sciences and physical science)
All students, volunteers, and staff members must receive the proper training
BEFORE
they begin working in the laboratory. The following information outlines minimum training requirements and additional resources:
The “Laboratory Safety Fundamental Concepts” class is required for all students, volunteers, and staff in laboratories. Please see the EH&S
training schedule
for class dates and enrollment instructions.
The “Laboratory Safety for Principle Investigators/Laboratory Supervisors” class is required for all PIs with laboratories. This class was specifically designed for faculty and supervisors in laboratory settings. Please see the EH&S
training schedule
for class dates and enrollment instructions.
Given the importance of fire safety, all new students, volunteers, and staff members should receive fire safety training. EH&S has developed a number of resources to assist you such as:
Safety Videos
For guidance on what training is required based on the type of research being conducted, please refer to the
lab safety training matrix
. For further information please refer to the EH&S Training FAQ –

Course 99. Student Research Program
SRP “99” are research experiences processed by the
Student Research Program – SRP
http://www.ugresearchsci.ucla.edu/srpintro.htm.
“99” course contracts do NOT need approval by Samueli Engineering Office of Academic and Student Affairs.  Please work directly with the SRP office.
Course 194. Research Group Seminars
If a Course 194 is available for the term,
it will be listed uder the academic department offering the course (e.g. COM SCI 194 or MECH&AE 194) on the
schedule of classes.
Enrollment is usually restricted to Instructor Consent, but once you have a PTE, you can enroll through
MyUCLA – http://my.ucla.edu/
like any other course.
Course 199. Directed Research

After selecting the Instructor, make sure to select the academic department that the Instructor is affiliated with, NOT “ENGR” (i.e. select the department as Computer Science if your Instructor is a Computer Science Professor, Bioengineering if your Instructor is a Professor in the Bioengineering Department etc.).
Engineering Department 199 contracts must be electronically signed by the faculty member and
department chair or vice-chair
. Faculty who are not able to electronically sign contracts may email confirmation. The confirmation must include the student’s name, UID, and contract number.
BIOINFR
will be considered an Engineering Department. For these requests, you will want to reach out to either Professor Sriram Sankararaman or Professor Eleazar Eskin to sign as the Department Chair.
We will not enforce signatures on Non-Engr 199 contracts, and will instead leave that up to the discretion of the department you are doing the contract with.
