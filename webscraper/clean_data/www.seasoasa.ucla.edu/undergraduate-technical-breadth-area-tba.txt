Undergraduate Technical Breadth Area
Faculty Executive Committee (FEC) Approved Regulations and Policies Outlining the Technical Breadth Requirement (effective Fall 2023 as of 09/25/2023)
The Technical Breadth Requirement (TBR)
is a 12.0 unit requirement designed to provide a student with the opportunity to gain working knowledge in a
technical
area
outside their major department
.   For example: students in the Bioengineering major cannot choose a technical breadth area (TBA) in Bioengineering.  Students must take three courses from one area.
To complete the requirement with three courses, those three courses must add up to at least 12.0 units.
Courses chosen to satisfy the technical breadth requirement
can not be used to satisfy other degree requirements
and students are responsible for meeting the requisites of courses selected.
Exceptions to the above are:
Students in the Computer Engineering major and the Computer Science and Engineering major are allowed to select any technical breadth area
including
Electrical and Computer Engineering or Computer Science.
Students may choose a course offered by their major department IF the course is part of a schoolwide area
and not being used to satisfy other degree requi
rements
. For example: CS majors may take COM SCI 112 for the Engineering Mathematics Area, but then may not “double count” that course to fulfill a Major Field Elective as well.
Students may take multiple department listed (M) courses as long as the course chosen is
not used to satisfy other degree requirements.
For example: CS major can use COM SCI M119 for the ECE TBR because it is also an ECE course but then may not “double count” that course to fulfill a Major Field Elective as well.
Students may petition, at 6426BH, to use one lower division course to satisfy a technical breadth elective IF that lower division course is a requisite for at least one of the two upper division technical breadth courses that the student takes from the same area (and that lower division course is
not being used to satisfy other degree requirements
).
Students are
not allowed
to use more than one course from the same subset in meeting degree requirements for any engineering major.
Please refer to the SUBSET RESTRICTIONS below before selecting an area and enrolling in courses.
