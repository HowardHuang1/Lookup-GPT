Ways to Reach an Academic Counselor
Message Center
:
Message Center is a service accessible through
MyUCLA
. The UCLA Samueli School of Engineering allows students to submit questions to our Undergraduate Academic Counselors via Message Center.
MyUCLA’s Message Center is the best way to communicate with our advising staff. Here you can ask general questions, submit petitions for review, and inquire on future course planning. Please filter your response to direct your message appropriately. You can search for a specific Academic Counseling Unit (e.g., Bioengineering) or specific Topic (e.g., Petitions/Exceptions: HSSEAS (Engineering).
Individual Appointments
:
Individual appointments are created through MyUCLA. More time is allotted for these appointments. If you want to discuss course planning, for example, this would be the more appropriate option. Appointment availability is subject to that Academic Counselor’s schedule.
Drop-In Advising
:
For the time being, our walk-in advising sessions will remain virtual. Days and times will be listed below. Drop-in advising is designed for quicker questions. Please note that wait times vary depending on many students are in the waiting room is. We will admit students based on the order that they entered the waiting room.
Tuesday: 9am-11am
Wednesday: 10am-12pm
Thursday: 2pm-4pm
