Latin Honors Eligibility Criteria
Students who have achieved scholastic distinction may be awarded the bachelor’s degree with honors.
To be eligible, students must have completed 90 or more units (72.0 units for transfer students) for a letter grade at the University of California and must have attained a cumulative grade-point average at graduation which places them in the top five percent of the school for summa cum laude, next five percent  for magna cum laude, and the next 10 percent  for cum laude
.
The minimum GPAs required are subject to change on an annual basis.
Required GPAs in effect in the graduating year determine student eligibility
.
In Addition,
the School requires:
that grades achieved in total upper-division courses applied to a specific UCLA Samueli degree requirement*
must meet the minimum cutoffs and
The upper-division GPA may be .1 lower than the required summa cum laude, magna cum laude, or cum laude GPA cutoffs.
a minimum 3.25 GPA in in their major field upper-division courses*.
*Upper division courses that are excess units and not applied to a specific HSSEAS B.S. degree requirement, as well as upper division courses applied to an additional major, or minor, that are NOT ALSO applied to the HSSEAS B.S. degree requirements are excluded from these UPPER DIVISION GPAs for purposes of HSSEAS Latin honors.
*Summer degree candidates will be awarded Latin honors based on the past academic year’s criteria (eg. Summer 2019 will be based on 2018-2019 criteria). While Fall will be based on that present academic year’s criteria (eg. Fall 2019 based on 2019-2020 criteria).
