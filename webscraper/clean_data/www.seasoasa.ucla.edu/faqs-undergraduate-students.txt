Advising and Grading Options & Policies
+
Academic Probation: What does it mean if I’m on academic probation or subject to dismissal?
You will be placed on probation if your term or overall grade-point average (GPA) falls between 1.5 and 1.99. You will be subject to
dismissal if your grade-point average in any one term is less than 1.5 OR if you do not earn at least a C (2.0) average in any one term when you were on probation OR if you do not end probation by the end of the next term. Subject to Dismissal does not mean that you are going to be immediately dismissed; however, you must make an appointment to meet with your OASA Counselor who will explain the conditions under which you will be allowed to continue. You should meet with your Counselor in the Office of Academic and Student Affairs (OASA, 6426 BH) if you have been notified that you are on academic probation or subject to dismissal.
+
Academic Standing: What does it mean if I’m in “good academic standing”?
You are in “good academic standing” if at the close of a regular term you have attained a “C” (2.0) average for the term and a cumulative “C” (2.0) average in all University work.
+
Class Rank: Does UCLA provide ranking information?
UCLA does not provide official rank information as outlined at
https://www.apb.ucla.edu/faq/class-rank
You can have some indication of how you measure up against your peers, by reviewing the Latin Honors cutoff for the academic year
you graduate (or present academic year if your degree completion term is well into the future and not yet determined).
For example if your degree completion term was Fall ‘10 or you plan to complete after the Winter ‘11 term, your degree completion academic year
is 2010-11 and you may compare your standing to other students by a statement such as follows:
“UCLA does not assign individual rankings to students. If you receive Latin Honors, you have some indication of how you
measure up against your peers. For UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, if you graduated summa cum laude, you’re in the top 5% of your class; magna cum laude, top 10%; cum laude, top 20%.”
More Information can be found at this link:
Latin Honors
Additionally, you can contact your
UCLA Samueli School of Engineering academic counselor
who may be able to give you unofficial, limited rank information, run from an internal UCLA Samueli School of Engineering report.

hold
can remove it for you. You should contact the department who placed the
hold
and they will tell you what you must do to have the
hold
removed. Usually there will be a number or email you can contact next to the
hold
.
+
Incomplete Grade: What is an “I” Incomplete grade?
Incomplete Grades
The instructor may assign the incomplete (I) grade under the following conditions: the student must ask the Instructor for the I grade, the student’s work must be of passing quality and the reasons for requesting the I grade must be of sufficient gravity to warrant an incomplete grade (such as illness or other serious problem). It is the student’s responsibility to discuss with the instructor the possibility of receiving an I grade as opposed to a nonpassing grade.  However, a professor may certainly reach out to a student and suggest an incomplete if they feel the situation is appropriate.
How do these rules apply to students who miss a final exam?  If a student does not take the final exam and never contacts the instructor, the student receives the grade they have earned with their completed work up to that point, usually an F.  Consistent with the above discussion, if a student contacts the instructor providing a   valid and documented reason (e.g. illness), the student will receive an incomplete (I), if and only if the student has a passing grade (C- or higher) at that point.  Again, a professor may reach out to a student who misses a final if they feel it is appropriate.  If an incomplete is given, the student must make arrangements with the instructor to take the final exam the following quarter.
If an I grade is assigned, students may receive unit credit and grade points by satisfactorily completing the coursework as specified by the instructor. Students should not re-enroll in the course; if they do, it is recorded twice on the transcript. If the work is not completed by the end of the next full term in residence, the I grade lapses to an F, NP, or U as appropriate. The College or school may extend the deadline in unusual cases (not applicable to graduate students). Once an Incomplete (I) grade is assigned, it remains on the transcript along with the passing grade students may later receive for the course.
+
Pass/No Pass: Is it possible to take a course on P/NP grading?
Passed/Not Passed (P/NP) Eligibility
Required courses (e.g. math, science, prep for the major, major courses, major electives, technical breadth, Engl Comp 3, ethics, etc.)  for all UCLA Samueli School of Engineering majors and minors must be taken for a letter grade (unless the course is graded P/NP only)
.
If an engineering course is LG this means students do not have the PNP option regardless of major.
For engineering students, ONLY courses that are PNP ONLY or General Education (GE) or excess units (not required courses) AND
also have the Student  Option (SO) grade designation (Listed in the Schedule of Classes as may be taken for Letter grade or Pass/Not Pass) may be taken for P/NP if the student is in good academic standing.
In addition to the above, further restrictions on taking a course P.NP are:
A) an engineering student can enroll in courses that are P/NP grading  only up to four units in one quarter without any additional UCLA Samueli School of Engineering restrictions or requirements.  A student who has not elected the P/NP option, if eligible, in the immediate previous term (last regular term enrolled (excludes summer)
may petition
to take two grading optional courses (maximum 10 units) P/NP.
B) For courses that are grading optional (letter grade OR P/NP), students are allowed to enroll in one grading option course (up to 5 units) under P/NP in a quarter if they are:
are in good academic standing (2.0 or higher term and cumulative GPA) and
have not received two NP grades. Students who have received two NP grades shall be excluded from electing courses on a P/NP basis for one quarter and
are not repeating a course in which a grade of C-, D+, D, D- or F has been earned. Courses in which a letter grade is received may NOT be repeated on a P/NP  basis. Courses originally taken on a P/NP  basis may be repeated on the same basis or for a letter grade.
C) During Summer Sessions, for GE courses that are grading optional (letter grade OR P/NP), students are allowed to enroll in one grading option course (up to 5 units) under P/NP if they
are:
are in good academic standing (2.0 or higher term and cumulative GPA) and
have not received two NP grades. Students who have received two NP grades shall be excluded from electing courses on a P/NP basis for one quarter and
are not repeating a course in which a grade of C-, D+, D, D- or F has been earned.  Courses in which a letter grade is received may NOT be repeated on a P/NP  basis. Courses originally taken on a P/NP  basis may be repeated on the same basis or for a letter grade.
Passed/Not Passed and Equivalent Letter Grades
In order to receive a Passed “P” grade, you must achieve a grade of
C or better.
Work done at the level of C- or below will be given a Not Passed “NP” and you will earn no units toward graduation.
+
Repeating Courses: Do I have to repeat a course that I received a C- in?
Grades above an “F” do not have to be repeated (with the exception of the Ethics course requirements (ENGR 183EW, ENGR 185EW, BIOENGR 165EW), English 3, Subject A, English as a Second Language, and American History and Institutions required courses which all must be passed with a minimum grade of “C”).
If a course is required for your major and you receive an “F”, you must repeat it.
You may have the option to repeat courses in which you have received a “C-” or lower grade or NP if you have not previously repeated that course.
Some Departments (such as Chem) recommend that students earn at least a “C-” or higher before going on to the next level course and this information is normally specified in the requisite information in the course description such as:
Chem 20B. Chemical Energetics and Change. (4)
Lecture, three hours; discussion, one hour. Enforced requisites: course 20A or 20AH, and Mathematics 31A,
with grades of C- or bette
r.
Some departments (such as Math) may have credit limitations on repeats which are usually noted in the General catalog in the section for that department under Credit Limitations such as:
Credit Limitations:
For lower division mathematics courses
, students may not take or repeat a course for credit if it is a requisite for a more advanced lower division course for which they already have credit. This applies in particular to the repetition of courses (e.g., if students wish to repeat Mathematics 31B, they must do so before completing course 32B; if students wish to repeat Mathematics 3B or 31B or 32A, they must do so before completing course 33A).
You must meet certain
GPA requirements to graduate
. If you receive a grade lower than “C”, you are advised to meet with your OASA Counselor.
See more repeat rule information detailed below under “
How many courses can I repeat and will the first grade be removed from my transcrip
t? ”
+
Repeating Courses: How many courses can I repeat and will the first grade be removed from my transcript?
The grade assigned each time you take a course will be permanently recorded on your transcript.
To improve the grade-point average, students may repeat only those courses in which they receive a grade of C- or lower; NP or U grades may be repeated to gain unit credit. Courses in which a letter grade is received may not be repeated on a P/NP or S/U basis. Courses originally taken on a P/NP or S/U basis may be repeated on the same basis or for a letter grade.
Repetition of a course more than once requires the approval of the College or school or the dean of the Graduate Division, and is granted only under extraordinary circumstances.
Degree credit for a course is given only once, but the grade assigned each time the course is taken is permanently recorded on the transcript.
For undergraduates who repeat a total of 16 units or less, only the most recently earned letter grades and grade
points are computed in the GPA. After repeating 16 units, however, the GPA is based on all letter grades assigned and total units attempted.
There is no guarantee that in a later term a course can be repeated (such as in cases when  a course is deleted or no longer offered).  In these cases a student should consult with their academic counselor to determine if there is an alternate course the student needs to take to satisfy a requirement.  The alternate course would NOT count as a repeat of the original course.
+
What are the requirements for Dean's Honors?
Students following the engineering curricula are eligible to be named to the Dean’s Honors List each term. Minimum requirements are a course load of at least 15 units (12 units of letter grade) with a grade-point average equal to or greater than 3.7. Students are not eligible for the Dean’s Honors List if they receive an Incomplete (I) or Not Passed (NP) grade or repeat a course. Only courses applicable to an undergraduate degree are considered toward eligibility for Dean’s Honors.
Enrollment Policies and Deadlines
+
Appointment times for enrollment – how are they assigned?
Per the Registrar’s Office,
U
ndergraduates eligible to enroll for the next term do so during two randomly assigned appointments,
which fall within pass periods that are prioritized as follows:
Priority pass
160 or more degree units and declared candidacy to graduate in next two terms
160 or more units
New and re-entering students
135–159.9 units
90–134.9 units
45–89.9 units
0–44.9 units
The Registrar’s full explanation is detailed at the following website
http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Registration-Classes/Enrollment-Appointments/Enrollment-Appointments
Effective W16, in order to ensure that students have access to courses that are appropriate for their “true class” level,
a new system was devised by the UCLA campus that eliminated AP and IB units from the calculations of appointment times.
The new appointments are based on where a student is according to their true year in school, so that students may get access to the courses that they need in order to graduate.
For example, a true senior who needs a course for their major will no longer be competing for a course with a student who has senior
standing due to AP units.
Previously, the appointment times had more students at certain levels, creating large numbers of students enrolling  in certain class size times (e.g., freshman, sophomores, juniors, seniors) that were not consistent with the actual class size.
In addition, some students would have an enrollment time that allowed them to take courses that they were not necessarily ready for academically.
The units from AP and IB tests still count and apply toward certain course degree requirements as detailed for UCLA Samueli School of Engineering at
http://www.seasoasa.ucla.edu/curric-14-15/07ugrad-14.html
AP/IB units also will count towards class standing – for example, if a student wants to take a course that is restricted to
“JUNIORS AND ABOVE”  a student can do so if the AP/IB units puts that student at the junior level.
The removal of AP/IB units only affects the system of assigning enrollment appointment times.
In addition, taking AP and IB courses counted toward a student’s admission to UCLA.

Dropping Courses: My friend, who is in the College of Letters & Science, says that I can drop a course through 10th week of the term. – Is that true?
No, the deadline (
Deadlines and Enrollment Policies
) to drop a non-impacted course for UCLA Samueli School of Engineering students is Friday of fourth week of
the term via myUCLA until 5 p.m., even if it is an  L&S course. The deadline to drop an impacted course is second week of the term. The new
deadline to add any course is Friday of third week.
+
Dropping vs. Withdrawing: What is the difference between dropping a course and withdrawing?
To “drop” a course means to dis-enroll from one (or more) specific course(s), while continuing to attend others. UCLA Samueli School of Engineering students must meet
drop deadlines
and must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units per term. To “withdraw” means to discontinue attendance in ALL courses in which you are enrolled. UCLA Samueli School of Engineering students thinking of withdrawing
are encouraged to reach out to the
academic counselors
so that we can best advise them on their absence and help in their return
. Withdrawal requests can be submitted to the
petitions queue
and are subject to review and approval by the Dean. You may file a request to withdraw for consideration only if you have not taken any final examinations or otherwise completed the work in any of your classes.
+
Enrollment Options: Need help with enrollment options in undergraduate courses?
The following tips can be helpful when you are enrolling each term:
– prepare ahead by logging onto UCLA Samueli School of Engineering
Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS)
and knowing your course options needed to degree completion AND schedule an appointment to see your
Academic Counselor
BEFORE your enrollment begins
– do NOT enroll in time conflicted courses on the assumption that you will get into another section or a more preferred course at a later date
– when you begin to enroll, if you get a message from myUCLA stating the you do not meet the per-requisite or enrollment restrictions
refer
to here
.
–   if you are attempting to enroll in a course and the course is closed,  it is best that you EMAIL the lead counselor of the department that the course is under (e.g. CS course – email CS Counselor, Math course – email Math Counselor) BEFORE the term begins. Once the term starts there be limited assistance a counselor can give you, so be open to work with us.

Enrollment Restriction: myUCLA will not let me enroll due to an enrollment restriction and the course is needed for my major – how can I get enrolled?
Many departments limit FIRST pass enrollment to students in that department’s major(s) and then open the course enrollment to other majors either: Specific to Chemistry –
click here
– during SECOND pass.  This is the case with most UCLA Samueli School of Engineering courses (e.g. Bioengineering courses have a first pass enrollment restriction to bioengineering majors, then the courses open to other UCLA Samueli School of Engineering majors second pass).
OR
– specific to Com Sci 31, fall term offerings, after new student Summer Orientation (late August)
Priority Enrollment-  myUCLA will not allow priority enrollment for courses that have a wait list option only.  You must add yourself to the wait list during your FIRST pass.
+
Fee Reduction: I heard I can enroll in 10 units or less and get my fees reduced. Is this true?
UCLA Samueli School of Engineering undergraduates must enroll in 12-21 units each quarter. Students wishing to enroll in less than 12 units or more than 21 units must obtain approval by petition to the Associate Dean, 6426 Boelter Hall, prior to enrollment. Filing a petition does not guarantee approval. Normally UCLA Samueli School of Engineering students are only approved, by petition, to enroll in less than 12 units for reasons of: final term before degree completion and only needs less than 12 units to complete degree, employment with verification that student is working 20 or more hours a week or due to on going medical limitations with verification from doctor or trained professional,  Students approved by petition to enroll in 10 units or less may only be eligible for reduced fees as outlined at
fee reduction
. For more information go to the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering Office of Academic and Student Affairs, 6426BH.
+
Full /Closed Courses: I can’t enroll in a course because it is full, is there anything I can do?
If you cannot enroll in a course because that course is full, we encourage you to view the information posted at the following website (which includes a survey where you can register your interest in enrolling in a specific course):

+
Graduate Courses: As an undergraduate can I enroll in a graduate level course (courses numbered 200 and above)?
UCLA Samueli School of Engineering undergraduate students are not allowed to enroll in graduate level courses without first obtaining approval by petition at 6426BH.
See your UCLA Samueli School of Engineering Academic Counselor for more details. Students  must meet requisites and have at minimum a 3.0 GPA for approval consideration.
+
Late Enrollment Appointment: How come I received a late enrollment appointment?
Enrollment assignments are done by the Registrar’s Office and not by the School of Engineering.
Based on class level, enrollment appointments are assigned randomly within the times and dates shown at the Registrar’s and are based on student status when appointments are assigned.  Find exact enrollment appointment times through
myUCLA
.
Please refer to the Registrar’s link for clarification:
http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Registration-Classes/Enrollment-Appointments/Enrollment-Appointments
If you are a senior nearing graduation you are advised make sure you have declared a
degree expected term
at your earliest to ensure you receive the appropriate enrollment appointment.
+
Requisites: myUCLA says I do not meet the requisites, what is the problem?
MyUCLA may not recognize AP credit, EAP credit, or transfer credit from another school. MyUCLA may also have trouble recognizing approved petition substitutions for required courses.

Study List: What is my “study list” and where can I print it out?
Your study list refers to the courses in which you are enrolled for the term.
You can obtain a copy of your study list by logging onto
myucla
. You are advised to check your study list during the second week of each quarter to confirm your enrollment (checking second week will give you time to add or drop a course by the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering third week add deadline and fourth week drop deadline of non-impacted courses, if changes are needed). Check Study List at the beginning of 3rd week if on wait list for any course at end of 2nd week – wait list does NOT guarantee enrollment.
Faculty Advising Questions
+
Availability: How would I know when a faculty member is available to meet?
On
MyEngineering
, the student can click on “Change/View Advisors” and they can see each professor’s advising hours and office location.  They can also click “Contact” for the instructor’s email address.
+
Completion: How would I know that my visit has been recorded?
Students who have not yet had a recorded meeting with a faculty member during the current school year will get a warning message when they log
in to
MyEngineering
.
+
Discussion Content: What are we supposed to talk about with our Faculty Advisor?
You can ask them questions about the field that they are involved in.  You can discuss research opportunities, whether or not to pursue graduate school, companies in the field that have hired UCLA graduates in the past, or you can even discuss how the faculty member ended up as a
professor.
+
Frequency: How often am I supposed to meet with my faculty advisor?
UCLA Samueli School of Engineering students are expected to meet with their advisor at least once a year.  Your faculty advisor will post his/her office hours on
MyEngineering
.  Those students who have not met with their faculty advisor by the beginning of the 4th week of the spring quarter will have holds placed on their records.  Students are strongly encouraged to meet with their faculty advisors during the faculty member’s special advising hours during 2nd or 3rd week, but they may also try to contact them and set up meetings for other times.
+
Holds: How can I get rid of a hold on my record?
After completing your faculty advising meeting, make sure that the faculty advisor records the meeting in
MyEngineering
. Once the meeting is recorded complete the faculty advising survey. A link will appear on your MyEngineering. If you do not meet with a faculty advisor, then the hold will not be removed until after first pass in spring quarter.
+
Purpose: Why do I have to meet with my Faculty Advisor every year?
UCLA Samueli School of Engineering feels that it is important for students to develop relationships with faculty.  While students often don’t feel like they don’t have questions for the faculty early in their college careers, we feel that interacting with faculty early will make them feel more comfortable asking faculty for help in the future when it is more important.  A letter of recommendation from your faculty advisor will be more meaningful if they have met with you multiple times throughout your career.
+
Unavailable Advisor: What if my faculty advisor is unavailable or away on sabbatical?
Students can change faculty advisors on
MyEngineering
by clicking on the “My Advisors” link.  If the student does not want to change faculty advisors, they may see any faculty member in their department. The faculty has the ability to log in meetings with any student, even those who
are not their official assigned advisees.
+
What is it: What is Faculty Advising and why am I supposed to do it?
Each UCLA Samueli School of Engineering student is assigned a faculty advisor within the student’s department.  You can find out who your faculty advisor is by logging on to
MyEngineering
.  Faculty advisors are available if you have questions that your academic counselors may not be able to answer.  They can provide advice about graduate school, undergraduate research, and job opportunities in the industry.  It is our hope that you develop a relationship with them, especially since you may need them to write you a letter of recommendation.
Graduation Questions

Double Major or Minor: Is it possible to double major or earn a minor?
HSSEAS students in good academic standing may be permitted a double major or minor. The second major must be outside HSSEAS (e.g. Electrical Engineering major and Economics major).  HSSEAS students are not permitted to double major with two HSSEAS majors (e.g. Chemical Engineering and Civil Engineering).
To begin the possible option of adding a major or minor,
investigate possible options – For a full list of MAJORS and MINORS offered at UCLA refer to the UCLA General Catalog
http://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/
File an
Undergraduate Request to Double Major or Add Minor form
at the Office of Academic and Student Affairs (OASA), 6426 BH.  This form will start a review process by HSSEAS.
HSSEAS also advises that students meet with the Department Counselors of the major or minor student is considering adding in order to understand those requirements.
If HSSEAS determines that student meets HSSEAS eligibility for adding major or minor,  student will be advised to complete a Change of Major petition which must be approved by the Department of the major or minor student is requesting to add and then returned to 6426 Boelter Hall for final processing. UCLA Samueli School of Engineering determines final approval of a double major or minor request – review is done on a case by case basis, filing the request does NOT guarantee approval.
PLEASE NOTE: No more than 20 upper-division units may be shared by both majors.
If you are interested in a double major or minor you should meet with your OASA Counselor at 6426 BH.

Organizations: I want to announce an event to students, how can I do so?
Samueli Engineering Office of Academic and Student Affairs (OASA) Policy and Procedure on Requests to Post Announcements, or Mass Email Students, Concerning Opportunities and Campus Events
Central School units such as the Office of Academic and Student Affairs and SEASnet  are normally unable to comply with requests from groups to send mass emails to
Samueli Engineering
students. We do however realize that it is important for organizations to get their messages out to our students; therefore, we encourage the following options. If you are:
(a)
Samueli Engineering Student Organization
Please refer to the following communication tools:
https://www.seasnet.ucla.edu/
student-groups-communication-
tools/
(b)
School of Engineering Academic Departments
or a Group wanting to send a notice to
students in a particular
Samueli Engineering
department:
Each department MSO can authorize staff that they would like to have access to
MyEngineering
, which would allow the department to email students within their department. Sending announcements is up to the discretion of each department.
Samueli Engineering
departments who wish to send a notice to all
Samueli Engineering
students can request a posting on SEASnet’s MOTD and the LCD panels.
(c)
Industrial Affiliates or Other Company Employers
In an attempt to disseminate all internship/job opportunities and advertise all on campus industry recruitment events, we have created the
Samueli Engineering
Internship/Job Clearinghouse website.
Anyone interested in posting an internship/job opportunity on this webpage should e-mail
jobsinternships@seas.
ucla.edu
. All Industrial Affiliates and other company employers are also encouraged to post their current job/internship opportunities on UCLA Handshake through the Career Center.
Additional information on the UCLA Samueli Undergraduate Internship Program can be found at
https://www.seasoasa.ucla.
edu/undergraduate-internship-
program/
Industrial Affiliates or Other Company Employers may also want to work directly with the
Samueli Engineering
stud
ent organizations
who can assist with scheduling on-campus recruitment events.
(d)
UCLA Offices and Student Groups Outside of the School of Engineering (HSSEAS)
may want to submit a Registrar’s Service Request (RSR)
The Registrar’s Service Request
(RSR) application is used by staff, faculty, and student organizations to submit requests for student data. Services do include mass e-mails to students.

Transferring Courses
+
Another University Course Credit: What do I do if I want to take courses at another school during the summer?
Community College/Lower Division Transfer Limit.  After completing 105 quarter units toward the degree in all institutions attended, students are allowed no further unit credit for courses completed at a community college or for lower division courses completed at any institution outside of the University of California.
+
Transfer Credit: My transfer credits on my DPR aren’t matching what my counselor told me.  What’s wrong?
The DPR was designed for students in the College of Letters & Science and shows the Admissions Office’s evaluation of your transfer credit, NOT the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering evaluation.  The UCLA Samueli School of Engineering evaluation normally gives more usable credit, because it reflects your major requirements, which the DPR
does not. To verify what credit you have see a Counselor, 6426BH.
+
UCLA Extension: Can I take courses through UCLA extension to fill in classes while I’m at UCLA Samueli School of Engineering?
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (UCLA Samueli School of Engineering) does not permit continuing UCLA Samueli School of Engineering students to enroll in courses toward degree completion through UCLA Extension’s Concurrent Enrollment program. There are no exceptions to this policy – please refer to
