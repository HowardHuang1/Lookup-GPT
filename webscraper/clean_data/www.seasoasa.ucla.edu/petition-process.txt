Exception to Grading Basis
These petitions are rarely, if ever, approved for Engineering Courses. Engineering courses that are listed as Letter Grade Only must be taken for Letter Grade. This is the School’s policy and won’t can’t be changed through Petition or Appeal. It is also the School’s policy that degree requirements must be taken for Letter Grade.
For
Engineering
students
: The
ONLY
courses that may be taken for Pass/No Pass are General Education (GE) courses or courses taken for excess units. The courses taken for excess units must also list Pass/No Pass as a grading option and can’t be part of your degree requirements. You are limited to 5 units of Pass/No Pass units per quarter (essentially 1 GE course). If you weren’t enrolled in any Pass/No Pass units the previous quarter you can petition to enroll in an additional Pass/No Pass course the subsequent quarter (maximum 10 units).
For
Non-Engineering students
: If you enroll in an Engineering Course (even if it’s for general interest and not to satisfy a degree requirement), if it’s listed as Letter Grade Only you won’t be able to switch the grading basis. Please consider this when enrolling in Engineering Courses.
This request generally applies to Non-Engineering courses. Please keep in mind that other Departments, such as MGMT, also have courses which are listed as Letter Grade Only. For these courses, we won’t be able to switch the grading basis, it will be up to the discretion of that Department to allow the course to be taken under an alternative grading basis. Additional information related to Pass/No Pass grading policies can be found on our
Enrollment Policies
webpage.
