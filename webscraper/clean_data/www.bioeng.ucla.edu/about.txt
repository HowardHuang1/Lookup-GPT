Welcome to the Department of Bioengineering
UCLA is one of the leading research institutions in the world. With the top-ranked engineering school, medical school and many other academic programs on the same campus, UCLA offers a unique and extraordinary environment for multi-disciplinary biomedical research. Bioengineering research at UCLA emerged in the 1970s in the areas of medical implants and imaging. UCLA Bioengineering department was founded 20 years ago, and we have developed top-notch research and education programs. Our research and curriculum focus on five thrust areas: molecular, cellular and tissue engineering, biomedical devices and bioinstrumentation, biomedical imaging, biomedical data sciences and neural engineering. Currently Bioengineering Department has 14 core faculty, and we are engaged in an exciting phase of growth to recruit new talents. In addition, Bioengineering Department is supported by the collaborative efforts of 28 joint faculty, 77 affiliated faculty and 4 adjunct faculty in engineering, medicine, physical sciences, life sciences and industry. We work with diverse academic units in the UCLA ecosystem and promote multidisciplinary collaborations in biomedical engineering research and education.
Mission Statement
