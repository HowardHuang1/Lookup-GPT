Graduate Research
Graduate students in the department of bioengineering conduct cutting-edge research with our faculty, using extensive research facilities on campus, often in collaboration with other investigators across campus. Graduate student research spans a broad range of topics that our faculty specialize in, including biomaterials, biomedical devices, medical imaging & image processing, neuroengineering, and systems biology. Research covers the range from basic science discoveries to engineering design, clinical studies and clinical trials.  Graduate researchers often collaborate across campus with researchers in the David Geffen School of Medicine, the UCLA Health System Clinics, the College of Letters & Sciences, and the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI). Students have access to top of the line instruments and facilities housed in the department and larger core facilities on campus and the CNSI, including genomics, microscopy, flow cytometry, drug discovery, and tissue pathology.
