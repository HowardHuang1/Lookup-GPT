THE BIOLOGY MAJOR
The BIOLOGY major can be designed by students to include courses from a variety of life and physical sciences departments. This major is suitable for students who would like to obtain a broad knowledge of science, as well as for students preparing for careers in the health sciences.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
Undergraduates in the Biology major are expected to meet a standard set of requirements from introductory Life Science classes to upper division electives.  The courses build on each other to give students a well rounded education in Biology.

RULES FOR NEW BIOLOGY MAJOR (Fall 2020 and forward)
All Life Science Core Curriculum courses must be passed with a letter grade of C- or better and must be completed with an overall GPA of 2.00 (C) or better. Students receiving a grade below C- in three core curriculum courses, either in separate courses or repetitions of the same course, are ineligible to pursue the Biology major.
For the upper division (UD) major requirements, you must pass each course with a letter grade of D- or better. However, in order to graduate, you are required to maintain a global GPA (UD major requirements) of 2.00 or better.
A maximum of four (4) units of graduate work may be applied on the major, BUT only if approved by the department.
Two courses from each Core Principle are required.
Courses applied to the upper division (UD) major requirements may be applied to ONE Core Principle only. Courses listed in multiple categories MAY NOT be applied to multiple Core Principles simultaneously.
Minimum of 5 Upper Division courses for the major must be taken within the EE BIOL Department.
Minimum of 2 lab courses must be taken toward the degree, including a minimum of 1 Upper Division EE BIOL lab course.
In order to receive lab credit for EEB 100L, 109L, 113AL, or 162L, the corresponding lecture course (EEB 100, 109, 113A, and 162, respectively) must be completed, either as a pre-requisite or as a co-requisite. The lecture course may be applied to a separate Core Principle.
MIMG 101 + MIMG 100L – in order to receive lab credit for MIMG 100L, MIMG 101 must also be completed, either as a pre-requisite or as a co-requisite. However, MIMG 100L cannot be applied as a separate Core Principle since it is only three (3) units.
Credit deductions: students cannot take the following pairs of courses:
EE BIOL 120 & 185
EE BIOL 170 & PHYSCI 166
MCD BIOL 100 & 165A
FBQ/MBQ instructors determine which Core Principles their courses will help complete Upper Division requirements for the major (up to 4 requirements total).
A maximum of four (4) units of EE BIOL 199 OR eight (8) units of EE BIOL 198A & 198B may be applied to the major. Credit for 199 courses from other departments may NOT be applied.
NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS POLICY.
Each Primary Investigator (PI) will sign off on a form stating which Core Principle the student’s research course should count for, after the student’s work and quarter are completed. The research course must be for a minimum of 4 units.
Regarding classes offered by Molecular, Cell & Developmental Biology and Physiological Science (Department of Integrative Biology & Physiology, IBP): enrollment in ALL upper division (UD) Physiological Science courses will be restricted to their majors during first pass. You must consult the IBP department about enrollment in courses during second pass for UD elective Physiological Science courses. Non-Physiological Science majors are restricted from enrolling in PHYSCI 107 and 111A/B at ALL TIMES.
