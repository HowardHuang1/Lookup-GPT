How to Declare a Major or Minor
All students interested in declaring one of the programs offered by the department must have an established UCLA GPA and be in good academic standing (i.e., not on Academic Probation or Subject to Dismissal) at the time of requesting to change their major.
For students who have 150+ units (based on the 180 unit tab on the DARS), the
department must first obtain permission from your College Counseling unit (AAP, CAC,
Honors, Athletics) before your
request can be processed by our office.
All 150+ unit reviews are done by your assigned College Counseling unit, and can take
upwards of 15 business days.
How to Apply:
Major Change and/or Minor Declaration Requests:
10-15 business days (
Effective Spring quarter, March 29, 2021
)
.
Our office will only accept requests during the following weeks of regular quarters and Summer Sessions (any requests submitted outside of the noted weeks below will not be processed and a new request will need to be submitted at the next applicable timeframe):
Fall & Winter Quarters: Weeks 0 – 3; 8 – Finals Week
Spring Quarter: Weeks 0 – 5
Summer Session A: Weeks 3 – 6
Summer Session C: Weeks 1 – 6
