*** CONTRACT COURSE PROCEDURES FOR SPRING QUARTER 2020 (COVID-19 Protocol) ***
Contract Courses:
Following the University’s transition to online classes, you may submit your EEB 195, 196, 198A-D, and 199 contracts and a valid Lab Safety Fundamental Concepts (LSFC) certification, if required, online using the MyUCLA Message Center.  All documents should be submitted as a PDF attachment.  The submission deadline is 3:00 PM on Wednesday, April 8, 2020.  If you are unable to obtain the signature of your faculty mentor (our office will obtain the second signature, the Department Chair’s signature), please have your faculty mentor send an e-mail to Jessica Angus (jangus@lifesci.ucla.edu) to verify that they approve you to be in their lab.  This e-mail will be treated as an electronic signature.
When you submit the EEB 195, 196, 198A-D, and 199 contracts online, you should indicate whether or not you would like to enroll in the courses designated for lab meetings:  either or both EEB 193 and/or EEB 194B.  Please be aware that students may only enroll in these courses if they are enrolling in either EEB 198A-D or EEB 199.
Note: You may only enroll in the EEB 198A-D or EEB 199 if your faculty mentor is a full-time (ladder) faculty within the EEB department.  Names of eligible faculty mentors may be found at the Faculty page of the EEB website under the “Professors” heading (https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/faculty/#professors).
As you may be aware, students are allowed to enroll in a maximum of 19 units during a regular term, i.e., Fall, Winter, or Spring.  If adding the contract courses and/or lab meeting courses will cause you to exceed the 19-unit limit, you must do one of the following:
a)       Obtain permission from your College Counseling unit (AAP, CAC, Honors, Athletics) to enroll in more than 19 units;
b)      Indicate in your message which course(s) you would like dropped from your study list to accommodate the contract course and lab meeting course(s).
Our office only processes EEB 195, 196, 198A-D, and 199 contracts.  EEB 99 contracts are processed by the Undergraduate Research Center – Sciences (http://sciences.ugresearch.ucla.edu/).  The deadline to submit EEB 99 contracts to the URC is Friday, April 10, 2020, at 5:00PM.
