Petitioning EE BIOL 199 or EE BIOL 198A/198B to apply to the Core Principles of the Biology major (Fall 2020-current)
Students may apply either one (1) 4-unit EE BIOL 199 OR the combination of EE BIOL 198A and 198B to one of the five Core Principles.  Your faculty mentor would be the one to determine which of the Core Principles your EE BIOL 199 or 198A/198B should be applied to.  Please have your faculty mentor complete this form.  Once your form is signed, please submit it to the EEB Undergraduate Office via Message Center.
