Graduate Student Support Opportunities
Student Support Packages:
PhD support packages:
All Doctoral students receive support packages that provide a minimum of $30,000 annually, plus fees and tuition, derived from a combination of fellowships, teaching assistantships, and research assistantships. This support is provided up to five years unless a student finds support elsewhere and as long as the student is in good standing.
MS support packages:
All Master’s students receive support packages that provide six quarters (two academic years) of employment as Teaching Assistants. Teaching Assistants receive salary (currently $7,523 per quarter) and fee remissions that cover all standard tuition and fees. Non-resident tuition (NRT) is not covered by fee remissions or the Department, however, many of our Master’s students have successfully secured NRT funding from campus fellowships or home-country sponsorships.
Distinguished Fellowships for Incoming Students:
Top applicants to the Doctoral program are selected by the Department receive the following fellowships:
The Vavra Fellowship
