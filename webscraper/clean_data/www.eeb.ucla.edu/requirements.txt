Requirements
Applicants to the Ph.D. and M.S. programs should have a strong scholastic record and must be acceptable to the admissions committee. Our department does not require specific coursework for admission, but applicants should demonstrate sufficient preparation for advanced scholarship in the areas of ecology, evolution, and/or behavior.
Admission is highly competitive, with recently admitted cohorts ranging in size from 10-15 Ph.D. and 4-7 M.S. students. The availability and interest of faculty advisors in applicants’ areas of interest will be one factor considered in admissions decisions.
Applicants must submit an application online via
the UCLA Application for Graduate Admission
and meet the following requirements:
Minimum undergraduate cumulative GPA of 3.0
One official copy of undergraduate transcripts from all universities attended
Three letters of recommendation (preferably from professors/instructors)
Statement of Purpose
Personal History Statement
CV
TOEFL/IELTS: For applicants whose native language is not English, scores from either the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examinations. Please review
Graduate Division’s English Requirements
for graduate admission.
Please note GRE scores are no longer considered during the application review process. You may see a place for them on the general application, but you do not need to send us an official score report.
The general application form provides instructions of how to upload materials and submit letters of recommendation.
