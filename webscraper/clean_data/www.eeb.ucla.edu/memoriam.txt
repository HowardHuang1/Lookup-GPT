In Memoriam
Bennet Mills Allen (1877-1963)
Dr. Allen was the first chair of the former Department of Zoology. His fundamental contributions toward understanding the role of the endocrine glands in growth and development are a landmark in the formative period of modern endocrinology.

David Appleman (1899-1995)
Dr. Appleman spent 68 years at the University of California. “David Appleman and UCLA virtually grew up together.” Dr. Appleman’s research centered first on the nitrogen nutrition of citrus plants, and later on mammalian cancer biology.

Sarah Rogers Atsatt (1888-1971)
Dr. Atsatt was an authority on herpetology and reptilian behavior, who may have been the first woman faculty biologist at UCLA. The Pomona College Quarterly Magazine of October, 1917, has an article on lizard hunting in the San Jacinto Mountains by Sarah R. Atsatt ’10. Note that this is 1910, not 2010!

Carl Clawson Epling (1894-1968)
Dr. Epling is best known for being the major authority on the Lamiaceae (mint family) of the Americas from the 1920s to the 1960s. In his later years he also developed an interest in genetics and became one of the important figures in the development of the Neo-Darwinian synthesis.
Read more about Dr. Epling‘s life and work
Waldo Hamlet Furgason (1902-1975)
Dr. Furgason’s most significant scientific contribution was his establishment of the protozoan ciliate genus Tetrahymena. This resulted from his clarification of a group of similar genera and was based on a critical study of the morphological pattern of the organelles of the mouth area. In recent years, Tetrahymena has probably been investigated more thoroughly than any other ciliate. From the yearbook Southern Campus, 1920: “Dr. Furgason says, ‘If heaven were a place where one could ask God the answers to all one’s questions, it would be hell to a scientist.’”

Thomas Raymond Howell (1924-2004)
Dr. Howell was “a consummate professional who effectively bridged the older tradition of ornithology, with its eclectic background in taxonomy, systematics, classification, natural history and evolution, and the current emphases in behavior, physiology, ecology, and molecular genetics.”
Read more about Dr. Howell‘s life and work
Theodore Louis Jahn (1905-1979)
Dr. Jahn served as chair. “His research covered a broad field of biology, including protozoan taxonomy, protozoan physiology insect physiology, membrane bioelectric potentials, and bone formation.”
Read more about Dr. Jahn‘s life and work
Thomas William James (1918-1995)
Dr. James served as chair. His primary research was dominated by his interest in cell division. In order to examine biochemical events occurring at various stages of the cell cycle, he devoted much effort to establishing cell cycle synchrony (i.e., aligning the cells in a culture at the same part of the cell cycle). From these studies it was possible to establish the duration of the cell cycle as well as the beginning and end of events such as DNA synthesis.

Arthur Mourad Johnson (1878-1943)
Dr. Johnson was a leading authority on the taxonomy and plant ecology of the northwestern tier of states and of northern Minnesota.

J. Lee Kavanau (1922-2018)
Dr. Kavanau was a well-known developmental biologist in the early stages of his career and became an accomplished experimental animal behaviorist later on. He published a significant number of more theoretically oriented papers after retiring from UCLA over 20 years ago. His experimental studies of the last 15 years have related to avian behavior, evolution, and responses to unnatural light cycles, working primarily with small parrots. These studies led him into his most recent field of study, the evolution of mechanisms of memory (synaptic efficacy maintenance) and of sleep, and the function(s) of sleep.

Frank Elmer Peabody (1914-1958)
“His quiet and unassuming manner belied the impact that his studies on fossil trackways and the skeletal structures of reptiles and amphibians had in renewing an international focus of interest on the earliest evolution of reptiles and on the structure and habits of these long-extinct animals.” Dr. Peabody died while in active faculty service.
Read more about Dr. Peabody‘s life and work
Bernard O. Phinney (1917-2009)
“His observations were some of the first to show that this class of plant hormones, which affect such critical developmental phenomena as seed germination, stem elongation, and fertilization, could be understood using a biochemical genetics approach.” Dr. Phinney was a familiar and beloved figure on campus from 1947 until his death.
Read more about Dr. Phinney‘s life and work
Abraham Mandel Schechtman (1909-1962)
Dr. Schechtman and his students made notable contributions toward the demonstration that the structural maturation of the organism is accomplished at highly reproducible times by the onset of competence to synthesize specific protein components. Dr. Schechtman became, through his studies in depth in this area, one of the world leaders in this field. He died while in active faculty service, and the department’s Schechtman Award is named in his honor.

Otto Scherbaum (1925-1969)
Dr. Scherbaum elucidated the stages in nucleic acid synthesis, the changes in amino acid composition, the role of various enzymes at different periods in the cell cycle, alterations in carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, changes in phosphorus-containing compounds, as well as the temporal sequence of morphological changes in synchronized cells. He became one of the leading authorities in this new type of investigation into cell biology. Dr. Scherbaum died while in active faculty service, and the department’s Scherbaum Award is named in his honor.

Charles Arthur Schroeder (1913-2001)
During his long and productive teaching career, he conducted research on many subtropical and tropical fruits, both at UCLA and abroad. These included avocado, cherimoya, persimmon, loquat, white sapote, kiwi, cacao, peach palm, date, and citrus, among others. He was involved in some of the early exploration for avocado rootstocks in Mexico, Central America, Peru, and Ecuador. In addition to teaching and research, Art directed the first 16 years of the pioneering Fulbright project at UCLA and other southern California institutions, which continues today. He also spent several years as head of the Study Abroad Program at the University. In 1963 he was named one of six outstanding teachers of the year in the student annual, Southern Campus.

Vernon Theodore Stoutemyer (1905-1992)
In 1946, Dr. Stoutemyer was selected to chair the newly established Department of Floriculture and Ornamental Horticulture in the College of Agriculture at Los Angeles. Here he founded the first turf research program on the West Coast, which was greeted enthusiastically by managers of the golf courses and public parks that were then undergoing much expansion. Colleagues under his direction developed programs on the physiology and commercial production of several ornamental plant and flower crops, some involving the then new technique of plant tissue culture.

Boyd W. Walker (1917-2001)
In the 1950s, Dr. Walker headed the Salton Sea Project financed by the California State Department of Fish and Game. The project resulted in the benchmark publication, “Ecology of the Salton Sea.” This work provides a database that is one of the scientific foundations for current debates about the management and future of the Salton Sea. He believed strongly in field studies of fishes, and took his students and collaborators on many extensive field trips along the west coasts of California and Mexico and as far afield as the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.

Robert Wayne (1956-2022)
Dr. Bob Wayne was a pioneer in applying genomic technologies to studying evolutionary questions in a variety of species. He is best known for his work on dog domestication and the evolution of canids. Starting in the 1990, he also was the first to bring conservation genetics as a discipline to EEB at UCLA. In recent years, Bob reinvented himself scientifically by studying the role of deleterious mutations in extinction risk of small populations as well as using DNA from the environment to monitor biodiversity. Bob was a tenacious scientist and dedicated mentor to countless students.

Samuel Goodnow Wildman (1912-2004)
Dr. Wildman was an early member of the Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA. His viral studies led to the discovery of what he first called Fraction I protein, later named rubisco. This protein is found in chloroplasts and is an important enzyme in photosynthesis. It is also the most abundant protein in plants and probably on earth. The fact that he was able to crystallize it led to David Eisenberg’s group determining its three-dimensional structure. Sam continued his interest in chloroplasts with studies of their structure and particularly the organization of the photosynthetic membranes within chloroplasts.
