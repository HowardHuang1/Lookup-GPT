Resources and Links
Reporting Bias/Discrimination/Harassment
Resources for reporting bias/discrimination are outlined at
https://equity.ucla.edu/report-an-incident/
. It is important to note that you can report issues that you have experienced personally, or things that others have experienced.
Discrimination Prevention Office (DPO)
https://equity.ucla.edu/about-us/our-teams/civil-rights-office/discrimination-prevention
DPO handles a wide range of discrimination and bias issues from ethnicity to religion and veteran status, among others. However, DPO specifically handles cases where student, staff, or faculty have been discriminated by faculty. In cases where discrimination originates from staff, the Staff Diversity &AA/EEO Office handles the investigations.
Staff Diversity &AA/EEO Office
https://www.chr.ucla.edu/staff-diversity/filing-an-eeo-complaint
Sexual harassment and sexual violence
Issues involving sexual harassment and sexual violence are handled by the Title IX office.
https://www.sexualharassment.ucla.edu
Information on how to make a report is here:
https://www.sexualharassment.ucla.edu/making-a-report
. As a reminder, all UC employees (faculty, staff, postdocs, GSR, TA’s, etc) have a mandatory reporting requirement regarding sexual harassment/violence.
Because the distinctions between these offices can be confusing, or problems experienced by an individual may span these offices, there is an email where you can reach out to:
WeListen@equity.ucla.edu
and they can provide guidance. The Life Sciences Division Equity Advisor, is also happy to provide guidance, if you have any questions, and can try to direct you to the appropriate resources. He can be reached at
paulbarber@ucla.edu
