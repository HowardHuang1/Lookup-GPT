Graduate Support
World-class graduate students need support to devote their full efforts to their dissertation research. In addition, each year we honor an outstanding advanced graduate student with a Bartholomew Award to support field biology research.
George A. Bartholomew Endowment for Graduate Student Fellowship in Field Biology: Generously endowed by Ruth Bartholomew and George Bartholomew, our distinguished Professor Emeritus, the
George Bartholomew Field Biology Fellowship
provides a summer fellowship and research support for the top advanced graduate student in ecology, evolutionary biology, and/or conservation biology whose research has a significant field component.
Undergraduate Support
Motivated undergraduates want to participate in the Field Biology and Marine Biology quarter, unique and transformational courses. We want to provide financial support so that any interested undergraduate has access to these important programs.
Currently the area of greatest need in undergraduate support is for fellowships for students who want to take field biology and marine biology courses. Outstanding undergraduates who want to participate in these courses, but require financial assistance, will benefit from these funds. Help make our life-changing capstone
Field Biology Quarters
and
Marine Biology Quarters
accessible to UCLA undergraduates by donating to support these programs.
Field Quarter
Field Biology Quarter Fund: This fund allows the field biology quarter to be accessible to a broader range of students by subsidizing the student costs and reducing the overall cost of trips. To read more about the Field Biology Quarter see

.
Marine Biology Quarter Fund: This fund allows marine biology quarter to be accessible to a broader range of students by subsidizing the student costs and reducing the overall cost of trips. To read more about the Marine Biology Quarter see
http://www.eeb.ucla.edu/mbq
.
Joseph Epperson Memorial Scholarship: Due the generous donations of friends and family, the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology offers a scholarship to an outstanding student with financial need who wishes to participate in a field biology course.
Joseph Epperson
(Class of 2007) who recently passed away, majored in Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution and considered his field biology course one of the highlights of his undergraduate experience.
Chair’s Discretionary Fund
Gifts to this fund allow the department to allocate additional resources as needed to the fellowships and academic programs described above, helping both graduates and undergraduates to achieve their goals.
Help us educate the next generation of scholars, professionals and citizens for the biological, environmental and biotechnological challenges of the future.
