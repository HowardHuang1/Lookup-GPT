Master’s Degree Program in Biology, Specializing in the Ecology and Evolution of Medicine
Future breakthroughs in human health issues such as cancer, heart disease, infectious and zoonotic diseases, the human microbiome, and psychiatric illness will be advanced by a fundamental understanding and application of ecological and evolutionary principles. At UCLA, we have a vibrant Program in Evolutionary Medicine that spans multiple departments throughout our campus. Collaborations between faculty members at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and College of Letters and Sciences are at the heart of the Master’s program. The College contains a variety of top-ranked departments in the biomedical sciences as well as social sciences and there are a remarkable number of evolutionary biologists and ecologists who study health and disease across campus.
Students study advanced topics in ecology and evolutionary biology in the context of current medical practice. The program will include both coursework and experiences within the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, including Grand Round lectures at the David Geffen School of Medicine and other medical experiences. Students learn how and why ecological and evolutionary principles can be translated into biomedical successes. Graduates will be prepared for future medical and veterinary careers as well as academic graduate programs in the biomedical sciences.
The curriculum includes courses and seminars in Evolutionary Medicine and Applied Evolutionary Medicine, as well as coursework in evolution, ecology and behavior. This is a two-year program with a terminal comprehensive exam. The degree for this program will be reflected on the transcript as a Master’s of Science in Biology.
Incoming master’s students receive support packages that include two academic years (6 quarters) of teaching assistantships, which cover the cost of standard tuition and fees and provide a quarterly salary of approximately $7,500 per quarter.
