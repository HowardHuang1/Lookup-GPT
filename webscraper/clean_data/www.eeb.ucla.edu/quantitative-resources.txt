Quantitative Resources for EEB Graduate Students
Departmental/Divisional Resources
EEB Hacky Hours –
a weekly  co-working group organized by EEB graduate students. The goal is to get together to work on our coding (or sometimes non-coding) projects and ask help from each other in a relaxed but productive environment. There may also be short demos/walkthroughs of packages or other tools. Look out for emails announcing virtual Hacky Hours.
UCLA Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences
runs the
QCB Collaboratory
– free hands-on workshops tailored to individuals in the Biosciences Community who are interested in learning data analysis, programming and statistical techniques. (UCLA grads are eligible to receive course credit, visit website for details)
Campus Resources
UCLA Institute for Digital Research & Education
(IDRE) offers
Statistical consulting
– walk-in and appointment based; can be helpful, people’s experiences vary quite a bit. A staff member at IDRE also offer a
list of workshops
offered at UCLA from these group
-Office of Information Technology (OIT)
-Young Research Library (YRL)
-Institute for Digital Research and Education (IDRE)
-HumTech
-Cotsen Institute of Archaeology
-Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences (QCB)
-Institute of the Environment and Sustainability (IoES)
-UCLA Career Center
-UCLA Graduate Division
UCLA’s Data Science Center
–  a fairly new part of the Young Research Library. They aim to support researchers throughout the full data life cycle of activities: planning, data management, acquisition and storage, usage; analysis, publication. They have a
workshop calendar
.  The folks there might be particularly helpful with geospatial/urban ecology-related coding.
Community Resources
LA R/Python User Group
has monthly meetings focused on various aspects of programming and data analysis. Meet ups are now online. Prior to Covid some meetings were far from campus, but might be a good learning/networking opportunity for people thinking about doing data science.
R Ladies LA
– a women-led group of R Users that does workshops, presentations, etc., often on weekends and often on the UCLA campus. They are offering online workshops and presentations.
A handful of graduate students on campus are certified
Software Carpentry
instructors. The option may be of interest for those wishing to advance or share their knowledge.
