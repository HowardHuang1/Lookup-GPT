EEB ENROLLMENT RULES
&
PROCEDURES
The EEB department’s Undergraduate Office has specific enrollment procedures and restrictions on specific courses from the start of Priority Pass to the end of Second Pass for enrollment. Please review the tables above for key information about our courses and for specific terms.
Important information to keep in mind:
All enrollment management for EEB courses is done through the EEB Undergraduate Office.
We do not distribute Permission to Enroll (PTE) numbers for any of our EEB courses.
We do not conduct any discussion or lab section switches for any of our EEB courses. Students are responsible for conducting their own section switches. Please be advised that the enrollment system is not full proof, and there is a possibility for a student to lose their spot in a course due to other students monitoring available seats in courses. Please know the EEB Department does not over enroll our courses or distribute PTE numbers.
Wait lists are managed through the University automated wait list system.
All information about when restrictions will change and be lifted for a course can be found on the Class Detail page for a course via the Schedule of Classes.
Pre-requisites for a course must be successfully completed prior to taking the course.
Fall enrollment
ONLY
: if a course is allocated for incoming new Transfer students, enrollment for matriculated students in the course is paused during the duration of New Student Orientation. Please refer to the class notes to learn when the enrollment restrictions will be lifted. Please note that NSO restrictions will be lifted by New Student Sessions at the date and time of their choosing but never before 7am.
If an upper division EEB course is listed as an option for a non-EEB major and/or minor, students do not have priority access to the course. Please consult with the Academic Counselor for the designated major/minor to find other courses to fulfill your requirements.

ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE
Students are allowed to enroll in a maximum of 19 units without special permission during Fall, Winter and Spring Quarter. During Summer Sessions, students are allowed to enroll in a maximum of 18 units without special permission. To enroll in more than the allowed maximum units, students must obtain permission from your College Counseling unit (CAC, AAP, Honors, Athletics).
During
First Pass
, students are allowed to enroll in a maximum of 10 units total. You will be able to enroll in your remaining units once your
Second Pass
begins.
Some departments restrict enrollment into some of their classes, especially upper division courses (those numbered 100-199), during First Pass to the majors/minors in their department. These enrollment restrictions are usually lifted once Second Pass begins. If you still have difficulty, contact the department that is offering the class to assist you with enrollment. For example, contact the Chemistry department for Chem 153A.
TRANSFER STUDENTS
may have difficulty enrolling in classes, especially upper division courses. When you attempt to enroll into upper division classes, the student records system, URSA, may not allow you to enroll and may tell you that you did not complete the pre-requisites for the course, even if you have completed all the necessary pre-requisites. The reason it does this is because URSA does not recognize courses completed outside UCLA.
FOR ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE
contact the department that is offering the course. It is recommended that you e-mail the appropriate department with your enrollment request once your enrollment pass time has started. In your e-mail, include your name and UCLA ID with the class you want to add with the 9-digit SRS number of the class section(s), listed in priority order.
Departments can only add you to your requested class once your enrollment pass begins and IF there is still space in the class. Moreover, the departments are not able to assist you with your request outside of normal business hours (Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.). In addition, you cannot be added to a class for which you have not completed the pre-requisites.
