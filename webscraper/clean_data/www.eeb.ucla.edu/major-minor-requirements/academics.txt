Major / Minor Requirements
Pass/No Pass Updates
PASS/NO PASS GRADING OPTION FOR SPRING 2020, SUMMER 2020, FALL 2020, WINTER 2021, SPRING 2021, and SUMMER 2021 ONLY
Students have the option to take EEB courses (e.g. EEB 100) for a letter grade or Pass/No Pass. This grading option, Student Option (SO), has been updated in the system.
Student have the option to change their grading basis without a petition up until Friday of Week 9 during Spring 2021.
Students in our majors and minors are approved to complete requirements (lower and upper division) with a “Pass” grade.
If you are considering changing the grading basis for your courses toward your degree requirements from the Letter Grade to Pass/No Pass option, it is important to take the following points into consideration:
A grade of “Pass” has no effect on the GPA, but can fulfill requirements.
A grade of “No Pass” (NP) is based on receiving a cumulative grade in a course equivalent to a
C- or below
, and it does
not
fulfill requirements.

Students who major in our department must complete the courses in the Life Science Core Curriculum with a letter grade of C- or better and must be completed with an overall GPA of 2.00 (C) or better. If you receive a grade below a C- in two (2) Life Science Core Curriculum courses, either in separate courses or in repetitions of the same course, you are subject to dismissal from the departmental majors. Effective for only Fall 2018 admits to UCLA and forward, students within all three majors within the EEB Department will have their grades for the Life Science Core Curriculum courses monitored at the end of each quarter.
All courses to be applied on the major must be taken for a letter grade. This includes all courses in the Life Science Core Curriculum and all Upper Division major courses (numbered 100-199).
The College requires a total of 60 upper division units for graduation. Thus, you may be required to take additional UD courses (either within or outside of the major) to meet this requirement.

MAJOR AND DEGREE REQUIREMENTS
All courses to be applied to the major (both Lower Division and Upper Division) must be taken for a Letter Grade.
Lower Division Major courses must be passed with a minimum grade of “C-” or better and must be completed with an overall grade point average (GPA) or 2.00 (“C”). Students’ major status will be reviewed if a grade of “D” or “F” is received in two (2) Lower Division Major courses, either in separate courses or in repetitions of the same course.
Upper Division (UD) Major courses must be passed with a minimum grade of “D-” or better and must be completed with an overall global GPA (UD Major courses) of 2.00 or better (“C”).
Courses applied to the UD Major requirements may be applied to ONE major category only. If a course is listed in multiple categories, the course will only apply to one category.
A maximum of four (4) units of graduate work (courses numbered 200 and above) may be applied to the major, but only if pre-approved by the department.
A maximum of four (4) units of EE BIOL 199 OR eight (8) units EE BIOL 198A and 198B may be applied to the major. Credit for 199 courses from other departments may not be applied.
Courses applied to the UD Major requirements must have a minimum of four (4) units. Courses with fewer than four units may be combined to equal one (1) course equivalent, if they are applicable to the major (e.g., EE BIOL 175, EE BIOL 180A, EE BIOL 188). Thus, two (2) courses worth two 2 units each (for a total of 4 units) could equal one course requirement for the major. A maximum of one (1) course on the major is allowed in cases where two 2-unit courses are combined to equal one (1) course equivalent. However, one 6-unit course counts as only one course and not a course and one-half.
