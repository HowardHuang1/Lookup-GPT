Marine Biology Quarter
The Marine Biology Quarter (MBQ) is a field program designed to give advanced undergraduates an opportunity to gain intimate and first hand knowledge of marine communities, their constituents and their structure.
The MBQ program is the best!  Professor Nagy is so into marine biology and his enthusiasm shows.  My experience with MBQ changed my life forever

COST
The cost of the MBQ will be the regular quarterly registration fees plus additional fees to cover the cost of room and board and travel ($3500-$4000). Financial aid students may be able to revise their 2018-19 budget and apply for additional funds to cover the cost of the MBQ. If you have a University Housing contract (includes dorms, University Apartments) for the 2018-19 academic year, you will need to contact the UCLA Housing Office to revise your housing agreement for Spring Quarter 2019. Moreover, students with non-University rental and lease agreements will need to make necessary adjustments to their agreements.
The cost of the MBQ ($3500-$4000) will be due on three separate dates (dates TBA)]. If your final payment is not received by the due date, you will not be allowed to participate in the MBQ. More detailed information about the due dates will be forthcoming. Please be aware that the cost of the MBQ is in addition to your regular Spring Quarter 2019 regular quarterly registration fees.

MBQ Spring 2024, Moorea, French Polynesia
The Marine Biology Quarter (MBQ) is a field program that gives advanced undergraduates an opportunity to gain intimate and first-hand knowledge of marine communities, their constituents and their structure. It is also designed as a real-world training experience in devising and carrying through to completion scientific research projects in marine biology. This program will be a highly-focused research and learning experience. While working in groups on projects you create, you will be taught the skills to ask research questions in the field, collect data, analyze the data, write up the results, and share your discoveries with your class in a research symposium.
This MBQ introduces advanced undergraduates to field studies on the ecology of organisms living in their natural environments. We intend to intellectually connect this local work to larger scale regional and global issues as well as past and future climate change, and  make  students aware of the  range of techniques that can be applied beyond their work in Moorea. Most participants describe our field programs (FMBQ, MBQ, FBQ) as the highlight of their UCLA education.
The program consists of 16 upper division units that fulfills the marine quarter capstone requirement for Marine Biology major as well as the capstone experience for the Ecology Behavior and Evolution Major. For the Spring 2024 MBQ, we will visit the UC Gump Field Station in Moorea, French Polynesia. The faculty are Drs. David Jacobs and Anthony Baniaga.
This MBQ:
Depends on students having the background provided in the prerequisite courses
Fulfills the capstone requirement for Marine Biology and Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution majors
Counts towards upper division requirements (up to 4 courses) for Biology majors
Accepts students on a competitive basis, preferably with a GPA of at least 3.0
Preference is given to Marine Biology Majors, EBE Majors and and other students in the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology Department
Students in other departments are welcome to apply
MBQ Courses For
:
16 upper division units of coursework, 4 units for each course, course numbers will be determined.
Cost
:
The cost of the MBQ will be regular UCLA undergraduate tuition and fees,  plus fees to the EEB Department for additional costs associated with transportation, room, and board. If you are accepted for the Spring 2024 MBQ, a non-refundable deposit will be due after the interview process is complete. The official per student cost will be communicated to students a minimum of one quarter prior to the start of the program but in the past has ranged between $3,000 – 4,000.
Prerequisites
:
(Pre-requisites do not need to be completed prior to applying.)
Life Sciences 7B
EE BIOL 109 – Introduction to Marine Science
EE BIOL 109L – Introduction to Marine Science Laboratory
Statistics 13 or Life Science 40 (or equivalent course)
Three Zoom Meetings during Winter Quarter 2024
Competitive GPA
Valid passport
Snorkeling and Diving:
Snorkeling is required during the field quarter. However, during the course we will train any students that are not comfortable snorkeling, so this is not a barrier to application. Students that obtain their basic SCUBA certification must take an additional intensive scientific diving course that is offered at UCLA and several other Universities in order to dive in Moorea. If interested, please consult Mike Anghera (manghera@ucla.edu) as both basic SCUBA and this course must be completed prior to Spring 2024, so timing is critical.
Application Process
:
Applications for the Spring 2024 MBQ can be found
here.
For semi-finalists, a personal interview will be arranged through the EE Biology Undergraduate Office. Interviews will be scheduled soon after the application deadline, so please monitor your email.

Courses: The program consists of 16 upper division units that fulfills the field/marine quarter capstone requirement for Ecology Behavior and Evolution majors and the marine quarter requirement for Marine Biology majors.
Field Site: For the Spring 2025 MBQ, we will visit the UC Gump Field Station in Moorea, French Polynesia.
Faculty: Peggy Fong and Tonya Kane, both of whom are marine ecologists.
Application Link:
tinyurl.com/SP25MBQ
APPLICATION DEADLINE: FEBRUARY 20, 2024, AT 4:00PM (PST).
Past MBQ Locations:
Australia, New Zealand
Belize
French Polynesia, Mo’orea
UC Davis-Bodega Bay Marine Laboratories
Hawaii
Virgin Islands
Past MBQ Faculty:
Dr. Peggy Fong
Dr. Malcom Gordon
Dr. David Jacobs
Dr. Cheryl Ann Zimmer
Dr. Richard Zimmer
MBQ Procedures and Requirements:
Consists of 16 upper division units of coursework
Advantageous to have some training in field and marine related courses prior to participation in MBQ
Minimum GPA of 3.0 or above recommended
Requirement for Marine Biology majors
Fulfills the field quarter requirement for Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution (EBE) Major
Counts as upper division electives in categories 4 and/or 5 for Biology majors (curriculum prior to Fall 2020)
Preference is given to Marine Biology Majors, EBE Majors and to other students in the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology Department
Students in other departments are welcome to apply
Prerequisites:
Prerequisites for MBQ usually consist of Life Sciences 1 or 7B, EE Biol 109, and Stats 13 (or its equivalent).
Snorkeling/Scuba Diving:
The ability to snorkel is essential for the courses and clearance for scuba diving is strongly recommended. Each student must obtain qualified status from an accredited Diving Officer if s/he wants to dive while on the program. Information about the training programs will be made available at the time of the interview. Some MBQ locations do not involve scuba diving.
Cost:
The typical cost of the MBQ includes normal UCLA tuition plus room and board at the same rate as UCLA dorms with a meal plan. If you will be living in the dorms the year you plan to participate in the MBQ, you will need to cancel your housing contract for the quarter in which the MBQ is offered (in writing to the Residence Hall’s Assignment Office) and request assignment for the winter and spring when you return. If you live in an apartment, you might consider subletting your room while you are gone, but be advised that you may not be gone the entire quarter. Please contact the Financial Aid Office, A129J Murphy Hall, 206-0400, to find out if your aid can cover these costs. Scholarship information is available at the Scholarship Resource Center, 233 Covel Commons, 206-2875.
