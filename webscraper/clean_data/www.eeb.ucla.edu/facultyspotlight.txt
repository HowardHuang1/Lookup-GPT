David Jacobs
My research combines paleontological studies and geology with molecular approaches to  understand the early evolution of animal life.  We are pursuing this work as part of the  Advent  of Complex Life -NASA Astrobiology group, combining studies of the geologic and  geochemical context of this early evolution with studies of the phylogeny, genomics and  metabolic processes of relevant modern organisms. My student David Gold and I were just in  Newfoundland looking at the wonderfully preserved enigmatic Ediacaran fauna that precede the  Cambrian Radiation, the rapid appearance of most animal body plans a little over 500 million  years ago.  In our lab we use molecular approaches to examine the development and evolution of  sensory and neural organization of early branching animals such as jellyfish to better understand  this early evolution of animal complexity.  Another research theme in my lab explores the  differentiation and speciation of marine organisms along the west coast in the context of their  geologic history. Our work shows that the fauna of the California coast-perhaps the most  diverse temperate coastal marine fauna in the world-is a relict of a burst of speciation that took  place 12 to 5 million years ago when upwelling of nutrient rich waters and biotic productivity was  far higher than today. Our work has conservation implications. Understanding the processes that  form coastal habitats such as estuaries, and the ecology of the many endangered species that  evolved and live in them, is essential for making informed management decision as we confront  the dual challenges of development and climate change along the California and Gulf of  California coastlines.
