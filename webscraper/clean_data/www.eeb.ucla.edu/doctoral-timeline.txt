Doctoral Timeline
This timeline contains the required and recommended benchmarks for the successful completion of the doctoral degree. Specific details can be found in the
EEB Graduate Handbook
.
Year 1
Fall Quarter
Required:
September:
Prior to the quarter, attend new student orientation and take EEB 201, Introduction to R for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.
Students who are not California residents must begin gathering documentation to
establish residency
the following summer.
Sept/October: Students must form and meet as soon as possible with their Guidance Committee to plan coursework for their first year.
Take EEB 200A, Evolution
Recommended:
October: Attend weekend field excursion for new students, EEB 297
Winter Quarter
Required:
Take EEB 200 B, Ecology and EEB 250, Professional Skills for Biological Research
Spring Quarter
Required:
Take EEB 495, TA Preparation Seminar if TA-ing in Spring quarter
By the end of week 1, submit the first draft of the Departmental Written Qualifying Exam to guidance committee for feedback
By week 8 of Spring quarter, submit the final draft of the Departmental Written Qualifying Exam to guidance committee. Students must pass this exam at the PhD level before Year 2.
Summer
Recommended:
Conduct pilot studies / begin development of dissertation proposal.
Students who are not California residents,
must
apply for residency. The department does not guarantee payment of non-resident tuition for students who fail to obtain residency.
Year 2
Year-Long
Required:
Take an advanced quantitative course in Statistics, Biostatics, or Bioinformatics. This may be taken after advancement to candidacy if approved by faculty advisor.
Spring Quarter
Required:
Form doctoral committee and submit committee names to Graduate Student Affairs Officer.
Students must pass the Qualifying Exam and advance to doctoral candidacy between the end of the second year and Winter quarter of Year 3.
Year 3
Winter Quarter
Warning:
Any student who has not advanced to candidacy by the end of the Winter Quarter of Year 3 will lose “good standing” and risks losing on-going Departmental or University support (e.g., Teaching Assistantships, departmental funding, and some UCLA fellowships).
Recommended:
Students must meet with entire committee some time during year 3. This is an annual requirement starting the year after advancement to candidacy, but it’s always a good idea for students to stay in touch with committee members. A single meeting with all the committee present is preferable, but if it is logistically difficult or impossible individual meetings are acceptable.
Years 4 and 5
Year-Long
Required:
Until students have completed the Ph.D., each year they must arrange a physical meeting with dissertation committee members and file an annual progress report signed by all committee members to the Graduate Student Affairs Officer. A single meeting with all the committee present is preferable, but if it is logistically difficult or impossible individual meetings are acceptable.
Recommended:
During year 4, students should attend conferences, career events, and panels, to strengthen professional networks for upcoming job searches. Students should ideally apply for positions at least one year before they plan to file the dissertation.
During year 4 (or 5 if needed) Students should apply for the
UCLA Dissertation Year Fellowship
one year
before
their final year. Applications are usually due to the department in late February.
Graduating
Required:
Students must be enrolled in the quarter they plan to
file the dissertation
, or pay a “filing fee” in lieu of tuition during the filing quarter. Graduate Division deadlines vary by quarter, but typically dissertations are due Friday of finals week by 5 PM
