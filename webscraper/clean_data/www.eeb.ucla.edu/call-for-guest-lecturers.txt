Call for Guest Lecturers
As the Dean of the
UCLA Life Sciences
Division, I am pleased to present an exciting opportunity for our alumni to come to campus to share their professional adventures with students through the division’s undergraduate course Career Exploration in Life Sciences.
The course provides an overview of various career paths for Life Sciences students and helps them develop academic and professional skills in preparation for life after UCLA. Students are exposed to a speaker series where UCLA alumni share how they have applied their science degrees to their professional work, while providing alumni with a meaningful way to become involved with the division. We are thrilled to invite alumni like you back to campus to share your career and life experience with a class of highly motivated Life Sciences students.
Selected alumni will join us on campus as guest lecturers for 2020. Professor Rachel Kennison, who teaches the course, will coordinate with selected speakers about their presentations, which are followed by additional time for students to interact with alumni. The class meets on Tuesday’s from 4-6 pm.
The course also requires Life Science students to complete two 20-30 minute informational interviews with an alumnus or professional in a science related field. If you are interested in conducting these brief interviews by skype or in-person, please indicate your interest when you contact Professor Kennison at
rkennison@ceils.ucla.edu
.
Whether you are local or live out of the area and have the opportunity to travel to Los Angeles, we look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you for considering this opportunity to provide our students with the benefit of your experience.
Sincerely,
Victoria L. Sork
Professor and Dean, Life Sciences
UCLA College of Letters and Science
