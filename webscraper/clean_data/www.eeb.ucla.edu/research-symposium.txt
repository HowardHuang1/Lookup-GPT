The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology is once again sponsoring our Twenty-Fifth Annual EEB Research Symposium during the campus-wide Research Week, the week of Monday, May 23 through Friday, May 27, 2022.
This year’s Symposium will have an in-person Poster Session on Wednesday, May 25, 2022, from 1:00-4:00PM (PST) in Hershey Hall. In addition, posters will again be available for viewing on CCLE. This way, faculty, friends, family, and the Symposium Judges will be available to view posters for the duration of this year’s Research Week.
The Twenty-Fifth Annual Biology Research Symposium provides an excellent opportunity for our graduate and undergraduate students to present their work and to discuss the research that is taking place within the Department. Participating in the Symposium can also provide you an experience that you can include on your resume, curriculum vitae (CV), or any graduate or professional school applications. The Symposium will also give you the opportunity to share your research interests and to practice your presentation skills.
