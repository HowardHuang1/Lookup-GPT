Field Biology Quarter
Field Biology Quarter (FBQ) is a unique capstone experience that has a profound effect on our student’s lives. It enhances their future career success, and affects them on a deeply personal level.
During FBQ our students spend a full quarter conducting field research. Courses are taught both locally, in the deserts, mountains and coastal areas of California, and internationally, including the savannas of Africa, rainforests of Ecuador, and coral reefs of Australia. International courses are especially transformative for students, many of whom have never been immersed in a foreign culture, or exposed to the tremendous diversity of a tropical rainforest. The experiences these students carry away from these courses profoundly affect how they view the world, its people, and its fragile biota.
FBQ is unlike any other course the students have ever taken: it is an intense bout of learning that introduces students to the excitement of field-based research. Our professors strive to create an atmosphere in which students can learn to collaborate, help each other negotiate the challenges of research, and share in each other’s successes.
FBQ Information:
Consists of 16 upper division units of coursework
Minimum GPA of 3.0 or above recommended
FBQ is a requirement for Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution B.S.
Biology B.S. (admitted prior to Fall 2020): p
rovides equivalency for 1 Category Three Laboratory course, 2 Category Four electives, and 1 Category Five elective.
Marine Biology B.S. provides equivalency for the Marine Biology Quarter.
All UCLA students are welcome to apply.
Prerequisites:
Prerequisites for the FBQ usually include of Life Sciences 7B, EE Biol 100, and Stats 13 (or its equivalent).
Application Process:
Applications are available approximately one year in advance through the EEB Undergraduate CCLE Listserv and links on this page.
Cost:
The typical cost of the FBQ includes normal UCLA tuition plus room and board at the same rate as UCLA dorms with a meal plan. Please contact the Financial Aid Office, to find out if your aid can cover these costs. Scholarship information is available at the Scholarship Resource Center.
FBQ exemplifies what it should mean to be an undergraduate at one of the nation's top research universities.
Robert Walsh, Ecuador FBQ
...the FBQ was a period of personal growth for me. For me, it was the first time in a tropical rainforest without the luxuries of technology or heated water. I faced a lot of fears: my fear of insects in particular, of getting dirty, and of the dark. I came back to the U.S. with a sense of accomplishment and confidence, knowing that I had seen things that many people would never see in their lifetime.

Winter 2021 FBQ - Peru
Instructors: Dr. Greg Grether, Dr. Debra Shier
Winter 2021 Field Biology Quarter (FBQ)
Applications may be found here: 21W FBQ Google Doc
https://forms.gle/yHJe6M92wpdpoLpC7
The FIELD BIOLOGY QUARTER is a quarter-long, capstone program designed to give advanced undergraduates experience studying wild organisms in their natural environment. For most students, the FBQ is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that forever shapes how they view the biological world; for a few, it is the start of a rewarding career as a field biologist. Working in groups and individually, FBQ students design and carry out original research in the field, under the guidance of two instructors. Back on campus, students analyze their own data, review the relevant literature, write journal article-style reports, and give informal seminar presentations. Essentially, this is a crash course in the whole process of doing ecological field research.
In Winter 2021, the “field” will be the premier Amazonian rainforest site, Cocha Cashu Biological Station, in Manú National Park, Peru. Cocha Cashu was established in 1969 and has been under the management of the San Diego Zoo since 2011. The species list includes 15 species of monkeys, 17 mammalian carnivores, including 6 species of cats, over 500 species of birds, 82 species of amphibians, over 1000 species of plants, etc. In short, the site has incredible biological diversity. Cocha Cashu also has a well-designed but rustic infrastructure, with tent platforms, showers, dining facilities, library, water purification system, satellite-based communication system, etc. For more information on Concha Cashu, go to http://cochacashu.sandiegozooglobal.org/
Courses and Instructors:
EE Biol 132 – Field Behavioral Ecology (8 units) – Dr. Greg Grether
EE Biol 151B – Field Conservation Biology (8 units) – Dr. Debra Shier
The 16 upper division units of coursework fulfills the field quarter requirement for Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution (EBE) majors, 4 major courses for the Biology major, and fulfills 16 units of the Conservation Biology minor elective requirement. Qualified students in other majors and departments are welcome to apply.
Prerequisites and recommended courses:  Prerequisites for the FBQ are Life Sciences 1, EE Biol 100, or an equivalent course in animal ecology and behavior.  We also recommend that applicants take (1) one year of math and physics, (2) a course in statistics, and (3) one or more of following EE Biol courses: 129 (Animal Behavior); C126 (Behavioral Ecology); 122 (Ecology); 120 (Evolution); 116 (Conservation Biology); 114 (Ornithology); 113A/113AL (Herpetology; Herpetology Lab); 112 (Ichthyology); and 115 (Mammalogy).  EE Biol C126, 129 and 116 are the most directly relevant courses for this FBQ.
Cost:  Besides normal registration fees and tuition, there will be a mandatory student contribution to defray costs associated with the trip (travel, lodging, food, and supplies).  The student contribution for of the Winter 2021 trip remains to be determined but is estimated at $2000. Scholarships are available for students with financial needs (inquire in the EEB Undergrad Office). All students are encouraged to apply.
Students will be expected to update their passports and immunizations, as needed, and to bring certain personal items along on the trip (suitable clothing, toiletries, compass, flashlight, etc.).  If you are accepted, a non-refundable deposit of $500 will be due after the interview process is complete.
Application deadline and procedure:  Applications will be accepted until Sunday, February 2, 2020.  A subset of applicants will be invited for interviews during WEEK 7 of Winter Quarter 2020 (February 17-21, 2020).  Enrollment is capped at 15 students.

Spring 2023 FBQ - Los Angeles
SPRING QUARTER 2023 FIELD BIOLOGY QUARTER (FBQ) APPLICATION Urban Ecology & Evolution in Los Angeles
Professors: Elsa Ordway and Felipe Zapata
Application link
:
23S FBQ link
Application deadline
: Friday, April 29, 2022 at 4:00 PM (PST).
General Overview:
Urbanization is reshaping fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes, both locally and globally, with significant consequences for Earth’s biodiversity. Rapid urbanization is drastically changing habitat and biotic interactions. It is also driving systematic socioeconomic changes, which expand the impact of cities on natural resources beyond their boundaries. And we, humans, are both drivers and players of such fast-pace environmental transformation, with several unforeseen consequences. One of the biggest challenges in contemporary biology is to understand the mechanisms by which urban areas affect ecological and evolutionary processes. An ideal laboratory for today’s ecological and evolutionary studies is, thus, the city and other urban centers where we live.
In this new local Field Biology Quarter (FBQ), students will be introduced to doing field biology in a rapidly changing urban environment and biodiversity hotspot, the city of Los Angeles. The course will cover the fundamentals of experimental design and will emphasize the seemingly simple, yet critically important skill of
observing
nature,
formulating
research questions,
collecting
data,
analyzing
data, and
communicating
findings, all in one of the most exotic and exciting “biomes” of the Anthropocene. A central theme of this FBQ is to reflect on the role of humans as ecosystem engineers and the effects of our actions in the local environment as well as the other organisms that inhabit it. Students will explore different field sites across the city and will learn about the flora and fauna of urban LA. In addition, as a participant in this class, you will have the opportunity to explore and learn techniques and approaches relevant to contemporary field biology such as interacting with public databases and basic computational modeling. Because the course will be completely based in LA, students will not need to travel or spend the night in remote locations for the duration of the quarter. However, we will likely spend 1-2 nights together either camping or at a research station as part of a retreat at the beginning and end of the course
The FBQ satisfies the field quarter requirement for Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution (EBE) majors, counts as 4 major courses for the Biology major, and fulfills 16 units of the Conservation Biology minor elective requirement. Qualified students in other majors and departments are also welcome to apply.
Prerequisites and Recommended Courses:
Prerequisites for the FBQ are Life Sciences 7, EE Biol 100, or an equivalent course in animal ecology and behavior.  We also recommend that applicants take (1) one year of math and physics; (2) a course in statistics; and (3) one or more of following EE Biol courses: 103 (Plant Diversity and Evolution), 114 (Ornithology), 115 (Mammalogy), 116 (Conservation Biology), 120 (Evolution), 122 (Ecology), 128 (Plant Physiological Ecology), 129 (Animal Behavior), 136 (Ecological Restoration), 151A (Tropical Ecology), 160 (Intro to Plant Biology), 161 (Plant Ecology), and 162 (Plant Physiology).
Estimated Cost:
All qualified students are encouraged to apply. In addition to University registration fees and tuition, there may be some additional costs associated with the course, but we hope to keep these minimal. Students who qualify for financial aid may be able to apply for and earn subsidies and scholarships (inquire in the EEB Undergrad Office).
