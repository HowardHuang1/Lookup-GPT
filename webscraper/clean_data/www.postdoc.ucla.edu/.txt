Postdoctoral Scholars
Every year, UCLA hosts approximately 1,000 postdoctoral scholars (postdocs) from across the world. Engaged in advanced training and research, UCLA’s postdocs make significant contributions to the university’s educational and research missions.
As members of the UCLA community, postdocs have access to a world-class university and its resource network. This website is intended for prospective, new, and current UCLA postdocs who are looking for information about their position and benefits or about resources available to them at UCLA.
