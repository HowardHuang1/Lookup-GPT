Career Exploration with Handshake for Postdoctoral Scholars
Did you know that current UCLA postdocs have access to Handshake, UCLA’s event and job/internship platform maintained by the Career Center?
Current UCLA postdocs can jumpstart their career planning by following these three simple steps:
STEP 1:
Go to
ucla.joinhandshake.com
and log-in using your UCLA Single Sign-on credentials. From there, you can set up your profile to include your resume, upload a photo, and more information about your transferrable skills.
STEP 2:
Once you have your profile set up, explore the Handshake platform by browsing through Events (on the left-hand side top navigation bar) to see on-campus events and to register for them as well as to learn more about virtual or in-person events offered by external employers.
STEP 3:
Browse Jobs to see open positions. Set your search parameters to find positions that are open to those who are in “Postdoctoral Studies” and use the filters to customize your search. You can also learn more about Employers and search for specific ones using the database.
