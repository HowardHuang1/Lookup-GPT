Biomedical Research Society
UCLA is a world leader in research and education. To help foster a supportive environment for students involved in research, it is vital to create a community focused on mentorship. Therefore, the Biomedical Research Society extends support and guidance to foster a close knit community within the biomedical research minor while they pursue research studies of great potential and impact. This includes networking/educational workshops, informative graduate school panels, socials and a mentee/mentor program!
