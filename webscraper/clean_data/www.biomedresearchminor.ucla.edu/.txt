Helping students develop laboratory research skills
The Biomedical Research Minor is an innovative program designed to equip undergraduate students with essential scientific research skills. The associated courses teach students the logic of scientific inquiry in addition to developing skills in scientific writing, presentation of research data, analysis of primary research literature, and proficiency in experimental techniques. These curated courses allow students to explore the convergence of science, policy, ethics, history, and philosophy, thus broadening students’ perspectives and fostering a well-rounded educational experience.
Our faculty work closely with each student to facilitate their placement in an established research lab at UCLA that aligns with their scientific interests. Under the mentorship of esteemed UCLA faculty and lab members, students conduct cutting-edge science that contributes meaningfully to ongoing research in the lab, many of them earning authorship on one or more peer-reviewed publications. Students then share their progress and research findings at public presentation events. As students graduate, the culmination of their experience in the program comes in the form of a thesis detailing their undergraduate research accomplishments. Beyond the classroom and lab, the Biomedical Research Minor cultivates a dynamic community of peers and mentors, providing an environment of support and growth for students aspiring to pursue research-related careers.
The Biomedical Research Minor is a free-standing minor, not associated with any one department—so students from any major are eligible to
