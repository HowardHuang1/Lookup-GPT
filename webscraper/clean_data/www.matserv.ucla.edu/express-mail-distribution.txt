Handling Express Packages
FedEx and DHL packages are received between 9:00am and 11:00am Monday through Friday.

Regular, Certified, Registered, Express Delivery, and Confirmation Mail Policies and Procedures
It usually takes 24 hours from delivery by UCLA Mail & Document Services before mail/packages are received in the HSSEAS mail room.
Department mail stops should be open twice a day everyday. Mail stops not open at the time of pick-up or delivery, will have to wait until the next scheduled time.
We are unable to accommodate any new mail stops at this time.
At least one coordinator at each mail stop or someone at each department should be available to sign for packages.
Upon receiving of packages, coordinators will notify the corresponding faculty, staff, or students.
When you are looking for packages, please provide the recipient name, department, room number, company, carrier, and if possible, the tracking number.
When expecting a package, please contact the corresponding department coordinators.
Due to weight limitations set by HR for our staff, departments will be contacted to pickup packages that are over 40 lbs.  Packages over 40 lbs should be picked up promptly once the department has been notified.
