Recent Updates
Normal Operations Planned for Tomorrow, Monday, Feb. 5
Based on discussions with our campus response teams regarding current information and weather predictions associated with the storm, campus will remain open tomorrow, Feb. 5, and classes will occur as usual. However, extra caution should be used while commuting to campus as some roads may experience localized flooding. We recognize that employees travel to work from all over the Los Angeles basin and therefore we support managers and supervisors to allow flexibility for employees who may not be able to safely travel to work tomorrow and need to work remotely, if doing so meets departmental needs.
