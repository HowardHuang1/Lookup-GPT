What are EEAPPS Servers and Who Can Use These Machines?
EEAPPS
servers refer to a group of machines that may be used by EE classes.
If you log in to eeapps.seas.ucla.edu, you will be logged into one of the following servers:
eeapps01.seas.ucla.edu
eeapps02.seas.ucla.edu
eeapps03.seas.ucla.edu
eeapps04.seas.ucla.edu
eeapps05.seas.ucla.edu
eeapps06.seas.ucla.edu
You may use individual hostnames if you would like, but we recommend using
eeapps.seas.ucla.edu
for better load balancing and system maintenance.
Access is granted only to those users who are currently enrolled in EE classes in which the instructor has completed the
class activation
through MyEngineering.
You MUST be on the UCLA network to access the EEAPPS servers.
