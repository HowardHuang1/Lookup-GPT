Who has a SEASnet Email Address?
SEASnet accounts for faculty and staff come with an email address associated with the account in the form of
username@seas.ucla.edu
.
(SEASnet is in the process of migrating user email to G Suite as of 6/26/2018 and the users with G Suite account can sign in at gmail.com as
username@seas.ucla.edu
to access their email. Please see
https://www.seas.ucla.edu/gsuite
for detail)
SEASnet accounts for students do not come with an email address.
Most correspondence will be directed to the official email address on record at UCLA. However, there are times when SEASnet will contact you directly at another address (such as when you have registered an IP address with us using a different account, or there is a problem with your SEASnet account). Note that a requirement of having a SEASnet account with an email address is that you will either forward your email to an account that you do check, or you will check your SEASnet email regularly.
