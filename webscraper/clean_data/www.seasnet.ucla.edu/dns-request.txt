DNS Requests | SEASnet
Select Page
If you are requesting a new top-level campus domain name (ucla.edu), you need to first complete a
SEASnet Service Request form
.
If the purpose of the domain name is to have a website, we will need to know the following information in the Service Request form:
Where does the website reside (aka hosted)?
If the website is hosted on your own server within the SEASnet network, please let us know the IP address of the machine.
If you are using a third-party web hosting service outside SEASnet, we need to know:
a) The name of the web host provider.
b) The IP address of the domain name (an A record).
c) Links to how to setup the domain name with the third-party host.
After completing the SEASnet Service Request, please complete the campus
DNS Request Form
and E-Mail it to
help@seas.ucla.edu
. If you are requesting an IP Address for a seas.ucla.edu or ee.ucla.edu domain, please use the
IP Address Request Form
.
All requests must meet the campus domain name requirements listed in
UCLA Policy 411: Registration and Use of UCLA Domain Names
.  Failure to read the campus policy (specifically, section B, part 1C) will result in SEASnet returning the request to you for additional information.  If SEASnet staff time is required to formulate a request that meets campus policy, you will be billed for our time.  SEASnet will process the request within 1-2 business days after receiving the completed request. Although top-level domain name requests are routed by SEASnet, the approval decision is made by campus.  Please allow at least two weeks for a campus response.  The more complete the justification for your request, the less time is required for the review process. Not all requests are granted.  SEASnet recommends that you do not advertise your new domain name until you receive final approval from campus.
PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY DOMAIN HOSTED ON A NON-UCLA SERVER, REGARDLESS OF THE DOMAIN NAME,
MUST
BE REGISTERED AS FOLLOWS: “THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,” FOLLOWED BY THE NAME OF THE RESPONSIBLE CAMPUS ENTITY (
UCLA POLICY 411
, SECTION B, PART 2A).
