Class Websites
Class websites are hosted on
Bruin Learn
(a Canvas platform), see
coe.bruinlearn.ucla.edu
for complete details.

Publish your site well before the beginning of the quarter
because it can take up to 24 hours for students to gain access after the site is published and MyUCLA and Schedule of Classes only display links for published courses.
C/M/CM courses should have one site. Notify SEASnet if your C/M/CM courses appear on multiple sites.
Courses that are not C/M/CM are not combined until SEASnet receives a request (requests must be done quarterly).
If your TA(s) are incorrect, contact your departmental scheduler.
