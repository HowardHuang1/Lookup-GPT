Engineering Student Groups Communication Tools
There are multiple options available to student organizations for communication:
Student organizations can request an organization account at
UCLA Google Apps
.
Student organizations can request a
Google Groups Mailing List
.
Student organizations can request their departmental Student Affairs Officer or Management Services Officer send out emails to the students in that department. Only official student organization businesses may be sent and the department has the right to deny requests. Central School units, such as SEASnet and the Office of Academic and Student Affairs, are unable to comply with requests to email for student organizations.
