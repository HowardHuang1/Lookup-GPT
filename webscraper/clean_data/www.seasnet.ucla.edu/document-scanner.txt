The scanner has an automatic document feeder tray that can hold multiple sheets at a time. Note that scans may fail for large documents depending on the attachment size limit of the email program.
Priority use of the sender resides with instructors and TAs for engineering class related material to post on course websites, but is also available to faculty, staff and students for instructional purposes.
