Software may be restricted for the following reasons:
Licensing agreements. Some of our lab software has licensing agreements that state the software will only be used by students for their coursework.
Limited number of licenses. Some software in our labs has a limited number of licenses and cannot logistically be made available to all students without causing an inconvenience or problem for those students requiring it for course work.
Department purchased software. SEASnet restricts software purchased by departments for installation in the labs if requested.
