Research
From the derivation of the NEXUS C-Spine Rule to recently defining better outcomes with adjunctive antibiotics in the treatment of skin and soft tissue abscesses, UCLA Emergency Medicine has long been at the forefront of practice-changing research. Our program is fortunate to boast the largest number of active faculty and alumni on the Editorial Board of the Annals of Emergency Medicine.
There continues to be extensive research productivity and leadership at the highest levels by the faculty and residents. Since 1980, UCLA has supported a research fellowship with graduates who have gone on to become the academic leaders and research directors. Major research areas include: research methodology, clinical decision instruments, infectious disease, health services, neurologic emergencies, global health, health policy, health equity and disparities in care. The faculty and residents have produced hundreds of peer-reviewed publications over the last several years, including articles in the New England Journal of Medicine, Annals of Emergency Medicine, and JAMA. The department faculty are the creators of the EMERGEncy ID NET and NEXUS (National Emergency X-radiograph Utilization Study) networks and are also members of the PETAL network. In addition, research activities also include collaborative work with the National Clinical Scholars program at UCLA, RAND, the UCLA School of Public Health, the UCLA General Internal Medicine Health Services Research Department, and the West Los Angeles VA STAR (Specialty Team Advising Research) program.
