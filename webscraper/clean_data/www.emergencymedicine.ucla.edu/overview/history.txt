History of UCLA Emergency Medicine
In 1974, Dean Sherman Mellinkoff appointed a committee, chaired by Dr. William Longmire, that created the UCLA Emergency Medicine Center (EMC) in 1975. After a national search, Dr. Charles McElroy was selected as the first Director of the new EMC. The original seven full-time EM faculty included Charles R McElroy (Chief), Harvey Meislin (First Residency Director), Larry J Baraff, James T LeMay, Marie Kuhn, Ronald Busuttil, and F. Kristian Storm.
The UCLA Emergency Medicine Residency program accepted its first two classes in 1978 in a PGY 2-3 format. The residency program transitioned to a PGY 2-4 program in 1989 and PGY 1-4 in 2008. Over a nearly 40-year program history, our EM Residency Directors include: Harvey Meislin, David Orban, Jerome Hoffman, Sidney Starkman, Robert Galli, Pamela Dyne, Scott Votey, and Rebecca Bavolek.
