Research
The UCLA Emergency Medicine Research Fellowship Program, established in 1980, is a two year post-graduate training program. The fellowship harnesses the benefits of training at an internationally renowned university hospital and school of public health with exposure to the faculty and trainees of the National Clinician Scholars Program (formerly Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program), the Rand Graduate School in Santa Monica, and relevant departments on the UCLA main campus. This program provides an unusually diverse spectrum of research training. Entry to the fellowship program is available only to physicians who have completed an Emergency Medicine Residency.
