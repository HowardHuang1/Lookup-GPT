For over 25 years, the UCLA Center for Prehospital Care has the leading academic center on the West Coast for the study and improvement of prehospital care. The center has an international reputation for both the quality of its faculty and graduates, as well as high-quality and practice-changing research. Born out of an agreement between the UCLA Emergency Medicine Center and the Los Angeles Department of Community Safety's Emergency Medical Services, this academic hub has grown to become one of the largest educators of pre-hospital personnel in Southern California. The Center trains thousands of paramedics, EMTs, lifeguards, police officers, campus security officers, parking enforcement officers, dispatchers, and other first responders every year and routinely hosts continuing education programs on new and evolving issues within prehospital care.
Numerous residency alumni have pursued advanced fellowships in EMS/prehospital care and taken leadership positions across the country. Read more about Dr. Clayton Kazan (EM Class of 2005) who was
