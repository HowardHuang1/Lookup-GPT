Core Emergency Medicine Experience
The David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA requires a four-week Emergency Medicine core clerkship experience for all medical students starting in October 2022. This clerkship experience is offered at six sites (Olive View, Santa Monica, UCLA, West LA VA, Harbor, Kern). While all sites will introduce students to how to think critically about emergent complaints, each site offers a different lens into Emergency Medicine through direct exposure to the emergent evaluation of patients.
Students will be introduced to a basic algorithm for resuscitation of acute patients, practice targeted history and physical exam on undifferentiated patients (including chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and altered mental status) as well as practice in performing basic emergency procedures such as suturing, incision and drainage, and fracture management. The goal of this rotation is to introduce students to the acute management of undifferentiated patients and begin to develop their diagnostic framework including the use of diagnostic testing for common emergent complaints.  Students will also be exposed to social determinants of health and their effects on the patient care presentation, access to follow-up, and planning safe dispositions. Finally, students will be exposed to best practices for interacting with and the limitations of the Emergency Department.

This rotation is only available to UCLA DGSOM students
