Ultrasound Rotation
We offer a medical student ultrasound elective at UCLA Ronald Reagan/Olive View Emergency Medicine Residency Program for 4th year medical students. This rotation uses a blended learning approach that incorporates online didactics, quizzes, and supervised faculty scan shifts. This popular rotation teams up medical students with residents in a clinical team model that provides POCUS education as well as consultative support for ED clinicians. Please see our “
