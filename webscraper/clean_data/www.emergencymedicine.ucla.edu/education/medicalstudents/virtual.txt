Virtual Clerkship Experience
While we at UCLA Ronald Reagan/Olive View Emergency Medicine Program initially created this experience as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are happy to announce we will be continuing this virtual 2-week experience for this upcoming academic year.
While we would be thrilled to have you rotate in person, we recognize that not all students are able to
afford
