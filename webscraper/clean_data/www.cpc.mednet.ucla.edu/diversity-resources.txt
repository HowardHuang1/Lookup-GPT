Equity, Diversity & Inclusion
At UCLA, we believe a diverse and inclusive environment and workforce results in better service and education for our students and employees.
We believe that our commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion will result in better student outcomes, productivity, innovation and engagement throughout our educational programs, community services, and research engagements.
UCLA Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA welcomes all people and values their unique characteristics and experiences. We are committed to building stronger work relationships with each other and providing high-quality, equitable EMS education and services to the diverse populations that we serve.
Drawing strength from the diversity of our students, faculty, staff, and alumni is a core value of UCLA. At the Center for Prehospital Care, we strive to be inclusive, responsible, and responsive to the diverse needs of those we serve, including our students, our faculty and staff, and the communities in which we all live. With our graduates serving on the front line of medical care throughout Southern California and beyond, we owe nothing less to them, and to you.
What we believe:
Change must happen now to strive toward racial justice and equity
Equity, diversity and inclusion = greater productivity, innovation and engagement
Diverse, inclusive workforce and work environment enhances education outcomes, productivity, and engagement
Ongoing racially-based social and health injustices teach us we need to do more together
Collaboration is essential to research, education, and community engagement
We are committed to:
Advancing equity and justice for staff and the diverse students and communities we serve
Intentional actions embracing anti-racism and anti-bias principles
Ongoing comprehensive review of programs and practices to identify opportunities for improvement
Regular, ongoing dialogue with employees to co-develop detailed action plans
