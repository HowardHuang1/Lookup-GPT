Save-A-Life Online Workshop
We offer a range of the American Heart Association's life support courses for health professionals and others whose job or personal commitments require certification in these life-saving cardiac arrest managementÂ and first aid techniques. Because the UCLA Center for Prehospital Care is a leading EMS research center as well as a training center, your education here will always be state of the art.
If your organization requires BLS, ACLS, or PALS training for your staff, please contact Jenny Chang, our Community Training Center director, at 310-267-5959 to find out if we can design a custom training program to meet your needs.
