1970s
​​​
In 1969, Dr. Walter Graf shared with Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn his unique idea of having County firemen trained for a “coronary unit on wheels.”  In January of 1970, the Board of Supervisors approved two pilot studies on the training and use of Mobile Intensive Care Paramedics.
Supervisor Hahn also enlisted the aid of Hawthorne Senator James Wedworth and Lawndale Assemblyman Larry Townsend who authored the Wedworth-Townsend Paramedic Act of 1970. Paramedic training in California became possible when Governor Ronald Reagan signed the historic act on July 15, 1970.  In August, Paramedic Training in California is initiated at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital under the direction of Dr. Walter S. Graf.
At UCLA in the late 1970s, through the Department of Community Safety's Emergency Medical Services, campus EMS providers were being educated to provide the best patient care possible.  Campus police officers were receiving their initial EMT Training at UCLA.
This was the backdrop for what was to become the Center.  The idea was to bring together great educators and great ideas to deliver education, research, and system development in an academic medical center for the still relatively new field of prehospital care.
1980s
The idea and development of a center dedicated to prehospital education and research was born from the minds and efforts of our founders: Mr. David Caponero, Dr. Baxter Larmon, Dr. Steve Rottman, Mr. Tom Manix and Mr. Todd LeGassick. We gratefully acknowledge the many other men and women who through their work inspired what eventually became the UCLA Center for Prehospital Care, including John Barber, Charles “Chuck” McElroy, M.D., Dr. Marshall Morgan, Raymond Schultze, M.D., and Don “Smitty” Smith.
1987
The UCLA Center for Prehospital Care (CPC) was born out of the formal agreement between the UCLA Emergency Medicine Center and the Department of Community Safety’s Emergency Medical Services.
The goal for the new organization included the continued primary and secondary education of campus EMS providers and a quality assurance program started in the 1970s and designed to maintain an optimal patient care delivery system.  Training included the initial EMT Training for police officers, campus security officers, parking enforcement officers, and dispatchers; CPR training as part of the American Heart Association, and First Aid and First Responder courses; and continuing education training programs.
This agreement included a commitment that the UCLA Center for Prehospital Care would be developed at little or no cost to the University and should ultimately become self-supporting.
