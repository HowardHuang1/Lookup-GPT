UCLA Center for Prehospital Care Strategic Plan
Since our inception in 1987, the Center for Prehospital Care has furthered all four pillars of the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine’s strategic plan – education, research, community engagement and clinical care.  Over the past 35 years, we have served tens of thousands of providers and, through our graduates, cared for hundreds of thousands of patients as we forward the practice of medical education and research.
We are committed to preserving this rich legacy and focused on the future of this important work.  To that end, over the past year, we have engaged all our stakeholders – program faculty, clinical instructors, administrative staff, community partners, and leadership – to redefine our mission, affirm our values, and create a strategic plan that will guide the development of the Center over the next 3 to 5 years.  Our commitment to this mission-based work lives in our dedicated faculty and staff and the strategic plan that we created to outline these important priorities and initiatives.
