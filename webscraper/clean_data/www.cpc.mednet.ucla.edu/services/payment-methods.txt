Payment for course tuition and fees must be submitted at the time you register for the course. We cannot reserve a spot for you in a course without receiving payment. For your convenience we have several payment methods:
You can pay online or over the phone with a credit card. We accept MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover Card.  Payments by credit card are subject to a 2.75% processing fee, with a minimum fee of $3.00.
You may pay in person with a credit card, cashier’s check, or money order. Cashier’s checks or money orders are not subject to a processing fee.  Payments should be for the exact amount of the course fee and must be made payable to "UC Regents."  To make a payment in person, please visit our
