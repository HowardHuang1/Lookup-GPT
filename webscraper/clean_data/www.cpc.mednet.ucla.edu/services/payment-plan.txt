Payment plans are available for some of our courses, including:
Emergency Medical Technician
Paramedic
Licensed Phlebotomist
With a payment plan enrollment, you can enroll in a course and secure your seat with a down payment, and make the rest of the payments over time before the course starts. The full course fee must be paid by the beginning of the course, and our standard refund/transfer policy applies. There is also a fee for participating in a payment plan.
Your enrollment is not complete, and your seat is not secured, until your first payment is made.
To enroll in a payment plan, please do the following:
Send an email request to
cpc@mednet.ucla.edu
with the course name and date that you would like to enroll in the payment plan for and obtain a copy of the payment plan contract.
Watch the payment plan video and walk through your PDF payment plan contract.
Complete and e-sign the PDF form. If necessary, you can print out the form, sign it, and scan it.
Scan a copy of the front and back of your driver's license or passport. You can use an app such as Adobe Scanner or Tiny Scanner on your Apple or Android phone.
Return the form and your ID by email to
cpc@mednet.ucla.edu
.
We will contact you to schedule a meeting to go over the payment plan and make your first payment.
