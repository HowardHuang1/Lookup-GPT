NAEMT's Prehospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS) is recognized around the world as the leading continuing education program for prehospital emergency trauma care.  The mission of PHTLS is

PHTLS courses improve the quality of trauma care and decrease mortality. The program is based on a philosophy stressing the treatment of the multi-system trauma patient as a unique entity with specific needs.  PHTLS promotes critical thinking as the foundation for providing quality care. It is based on the belief that, given a good fund of knowledge and key principles, EMS practitioners are capable of making reasoned decisions regarding patient care.  This PHTLS course
is appropriate for EMTs, paramedics, nurses, physician assistants, physicians, and other prehospital providers.
This two-day course combines lecture with skill scenario stations to allow students the opportunity to apply the material they learn from lecture.
