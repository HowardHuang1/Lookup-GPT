We are the UCLA Center for Prehospital Care, the leading emergency and prehospital academic center on the West Coast. We are committed to improving the practice of EMS and have consolidated prehospital education, research, and system development into one major academic center.  Every day we go to work, we teach people to save lives.
As educators, researchers, and providers, we are proud of the contributions our center makes to the world of emergency medicine. Since our founding, our work has grown to encompass education, research, and institutional quality improvement. We serve aspiring and experienced EMS providers, agencies, and healthcare professionals in a variety of allied fields.
As part of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, we are the only emergency and prehospital academic center on the West Coast, with a national and international reputation for the quality of our faculty, graduates, and our research work.
We welcome visitors interested in our educational programs, quality improvement initiatives, and research. If you are an EMT considering Paramedic school, consider
attending one of our Paramedic lecture sessions
as a guest at no cost, or
