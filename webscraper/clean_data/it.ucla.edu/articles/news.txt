Life Sciences Security Incident
On January 24, 2024, our IT team identified and stopped an illegal intrusion into the Life Sciences Division IT environment. We believe our actions isolated the unauthorized access to the targeted area, which is 1.19% of the campus community. We have engaged a leading cybersecurity firm to assist in our response and notified the FBI. With their assistance, we are conducting a thorough assessment of the incident, including determining the extent of the impact to servers and data.
