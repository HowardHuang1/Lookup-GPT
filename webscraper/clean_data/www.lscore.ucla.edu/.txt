Broaden life science horizons for a new generation of students from diverse backgrounds.
The Life Sciences Core Education is the result of a cooperative effort by faculty, staff, and students from all six life science departments to provide a uniform and integrated set of courses during the first years as an undergraduate. The Core is a series of four courses in the life sciences (Life Sciences 7A, 7B, 7C and 23L), plus chemistry, mathematics and physics courses, which will make up approximately the first two years of course work in any of the life science majors. These four courses provide a broad picture of exciting current ideas in very different areas. Combined with the other courses of the Core Education, they form an extremely strong background that will prepare you for any of the life science majors. In addition to these four courses required for all life science students, we teach one general education course (Life Sciences 15) for students in majors outside the life sciences, to disseminate to the wider student population the most current ideas and issues in the life sciences today.
One of the innovative features of the Core Education is the courses will be taught by faculty and teaching assistants from all the different life science departments. You will have an opportunity to explore your interest in the various life science majors, while at the same time study an integrated set of biological principles. All life science students will take the same courses, so that when you finish the Core Education you are well prepared to enter any of the life science majors.
Although you need not choose a final major while you are completing the Core Education, it is best that you find your area of interest and select a preliminary major soon, so that you may obtain the most detailed and personal counseling possible as you plan your academic career.
