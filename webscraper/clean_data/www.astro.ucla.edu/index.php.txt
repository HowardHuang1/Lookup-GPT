Capitalizing on our dynamic location, intellectual capital and the inextinguishable desire to effect real change, UCLA is a 
            catalyst for innovation and economic growth. The impact UCLA has in just a single year is enormous.
The Astronomy Division needs your support. While UCLA is a public University, state funding has steadily decreased.
Private giving can help us educate promising young scientists who will make the discoveries of tomorrow.

Exploring the frontiers of the universe
Groundbreaking research, cutting-edge technology, award-winning faculty – UCLA’s Division of Astronomy & Astrophysics offers a 
            rewarding environment to pursue higher education and topical research. All members of the Division carry out active research programs 
            that garner widespread international recognition. Doctoral students can participate in a variety of research projects, which frequently 
            incorporate observations with the world’s largest ground-based telescopes, orbiting observatories, and other astronomical facilities.
Our PhD recipients go on to highly productive careers in academia, government, industry and business. Many have obtained prestigious 
            postdoctoral fellowships from entities such as the National Research Council, Hubble, NSF, Caltech Millikan, and Princeton Russell. 
            UCLA faculty have access to numerous observational facilities, including the 10-m telescopes of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, 
            and the Division has strong bonds with Physics, and with Earth, Planetary and Space Science.
