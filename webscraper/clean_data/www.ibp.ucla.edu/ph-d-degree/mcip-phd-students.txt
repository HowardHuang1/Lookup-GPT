Jenny Cheng
Master of Science in Physiological Science (2022) - University of California, Los Angeles
Bachelor of Science in Physiological Science (2020) - University of California, Los Angeles
Thesis Research:
I am interested in integrating multi-tissue multiomics data to dissect genetic and molecular perturbations in cardiovascular diseases via a systems biology approach. I am also interested in employing cutting-edge single cell techniques to further elucidate disease mechanisms at the cell level.
Mingjia Cheng
Master of Stomatology in Orthodontics (2018) - School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China
Bachelor of Dental Surgery (2015) - West China School of Stomatology, Sichuan University in Chengdu, China
Thesis Research:

Mirian Krystel De Siqueira
Master of Science in Genetics and Molecular Biology (2019) - State University of Campinas, Brazil & National Institutes of Health
Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Science (2016) - University Tuiuti of Paraná, Brazil & Rowan University
Thesis Research:
The adipocyte life cycle involves a complex and highly orchestrated program of gene expression. However, in vivo, detailed mechanisms underlying the molecular regulation are incompletely misunderstood.  My major research interest relies on studying novel nutrient-sensing genes and whether they have an impact on adipose tissue heterogeneity.
Jade Fachin
Master of Science in Physiological Science (2022) - University of California, Los Angeles
Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences (2018) - University of California, Merced

Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology- Exercise Science (2019) - California State Polytechnic University, Pomona
Thesis Research:
My research interests primarily encompass mitochondrial function, skeletal muscle physiology, and more generally biophysics in a variety of states, including in the healthy, diseased, and aging individual. I am interested in investigating these factors ranging from the molecular level to a translational perspective.
