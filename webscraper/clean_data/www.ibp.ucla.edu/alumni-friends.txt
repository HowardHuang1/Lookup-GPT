Dear Alumni and Friends:
Welcome back to Integrative Biology and Physiology at UCLA! Our alumni in Physiological Science and Kinesiology are a large, diverse, and accomplished group, and we are proud to honor them here. A newsletter is posted on this page each Fall and Spring, giving updates on you and your fellow alums, and on the exciting research being done in the department. As you read about the department and your fellow alumni, I hope that you will remember your time at UCLA and the value of your education and experience here.
For our friends in the community, your participation and support means a great deal to UCLA and our department. Thank you for your involvement!
Please update your contact information to help us reach you with news. You’ll be sent a twice-yearly notice that the latest IBP Alumni Newsletter is posted on our website. If you’d like to let us know what you are doing these days, email us at
IBPChair@ibp.ucla.edu
. Thank you for your interest, and welcome back to UCLA!
