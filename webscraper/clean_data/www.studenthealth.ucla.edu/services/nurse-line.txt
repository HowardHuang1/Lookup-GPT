24/7 Nurse Line
Advice and information from a registered nurse anytime.
Registered students can always call 310-825-4073, Option 2. The nurse will ask you some questions to help determine your health care needs. Based on the information you provide, the advice may be:
* Try home self-care. You may receive a follow-up phone call to determine how well home self-care is working.
* Schedule a routine appointment within the next two weeks, or an appointment at the earliest time available (within 64 hours), with your PCP.
* Contact your PCP for further discussion and assessment.
* Go to the nearest Emergency room.
* Call 911 immediately.
In addition to providing a nurse to help you make decisions about your health care, 24/7 NurseLine gives you free unlimited access to its AudioHealth Library featuring recorded information on hundreds of health care topics in English and Spanish. To access the AudioHealth Library, call toll free 1-877-351-3457 and follow the instructions given.
