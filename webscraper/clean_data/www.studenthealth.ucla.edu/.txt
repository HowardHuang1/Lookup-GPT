Bruins For Recovery (B4R)
Bruins for Recovery (B4R) is a student group committed to fostering a sober community on campus and raising awareness about recovery from drugs, alcohol, and other addictive behaviors. We believe that all students deserve to enjoy long-term recovery from addiction while building meaningful lives of academic and social engagement. Our Primary Mission is to ensure that every UCLA student who has a desire to get and stay sober has a safe and supportive place to go on campus. No UCLA student should have to be isolated while seeking to get or stay free from addiction. B4R aims to generate and sustain sober fellowship and community through numerous means, including: providing resources about recovery assets on campus, organizing fun and sober activities, and being a source of sober support for recovering students and their allies, friends, and families.
