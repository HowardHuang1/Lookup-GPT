Health Insurance
Health Insurance is mandatory for all UCLA registered students. All students are automatically enrolled in UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) and may
waive enrollment
if they already have health insurance.
UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UCSHIP)
UCSHIP
is a systemwide plan providing enhanced health benefits to all enrolled students. All registered students are automatically enrolled in UCSHIP, but if you have comparable insurance and you do not want to keep UCSHIP as dual coverage, you must submit a request to waive enrollment by the specified deadline. We have simplified the waiver process.

The Ashe Center is UCSHIP Students' Medical Home
The Ashe Center
serves as every UC SHIP student's
medical home
. Medical services must be initiated at The Ashe Center and a referral are required for all non-emergent services outside of Ashe. Claims will not be considered nor paid by Anthem Blue Cross without a valid Ashe Center referral.
Before seeking medical or mental health treatment anywhere outside of the Ashe Center or CAPS (e.g. out of state/out of country) you must receive a referral.
Mental health/substance abuse services must be initiated at
UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)
and continued care may be referred to UCLA Behavioral Health Services or other appropriate resources.

Waiving UCSHIP? Consider BruinCare!
The Ashe Center wants all UCLA students to feel comfortable accessing all of their medical needs through our facility, which is why we developed BruinCare. While many students waive UCSHIP, these students are likely to still utilize Ashe services because of our center's convenience and central location. All registered students can utilize The Ashe Center. BruinCare is a program that gives students who have waived UCSHIP prepaid access to certain services at The Ashe Center. By purchasing BruinCare during the waiver process, you eliminate the $25 visit fee, and more.
