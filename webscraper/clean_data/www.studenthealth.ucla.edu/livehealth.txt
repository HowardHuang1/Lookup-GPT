LiveHealth Online, telehealth by Anthem
Online video appointments (telemedicine) with an Anthem network provider when The Ashe Center is closed.
Your UC SHIP plan makes seeing a doctor easy when The Ashe Center is not available to you (building closures, away from campus, or if you just have a very busy schedule that prevents you from scheduling an in-person appointment).
LiveHealth Online provides access to U.S. board-certified doctors 24/7/365 via phone or online video consults for urgent, non-Emergency medical assistance, including the ability to write prescriptions. LiveHealth Online provides behavioral health services as well. If follow up care is required after a consult, the student must obtain a referral from the Ashe Center prior to seeking care outside of the Ashe Center.
