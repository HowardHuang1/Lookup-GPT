MAP
The UCLA Samueli School of Engineering’s Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity will be launching the Mathematics Achievement Program (MAP) to address and improve the mathematical deficiencies that often prevent students in under-resourced schools from succeeding in advanced high school math classes. The goals of MAP are:
Students will improve their math skills
Students will be confident in their mathematical abilities
Students will understand the importance of improving their mathematical knowledge and how it will impact their overall performance in all college-ready subjects
Students will have opportunities to create hands-on projects through math modeling
Students will improve their critical-thinking and problem-solving skills
Students achieve an improved STEM identity and believe they can be future engineers and computer scientists.

Students will be recruited for the program in the eighth grade. Students accepted into the program will be asked to commit to the program for four years. Below is the framework for how the program will be implemented
Math Classes
9th grade
– Geometry (will consider students currently enrolled in Algebra 1)
10th grade
– Algebra II
11th grade
– Pre-Calculus
12th grade
– College application preparation

Program Structure
Morning – Mathematics instruction to address knowledge gaps and build core competency
Afternoon – Enrichment activities will be added to reinforce concepts and connect theory with application in order to ignite career interest in engineering and computing. This will include but not be limited to:
Hands-on workshops
Group projects
Tours of UCLA engineering research labs
Guest speakers (faculty/students/alumni)
Field trips to aerospace, energy and technology companies
MAP Eligibility Requirements
All applicants must meet the following eligibility criteria to apply to the program.
Students currently enrolled in the eighth grade
Passed their seventh grade math class with a B or better
Completing Algebra 1 by June 2023.
Overall GPA of 3.0 or above
