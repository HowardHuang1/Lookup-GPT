UCLA MESA Program
About
The UCLA MESA College Prep Program is one of 19 university centers in the Mathematics Engineering and Science Achievement (
MESA
) Statewide organization. MESA’s mission is to enable economically disadvantaged students to prepare for and pursue a math-based degree in areas such as science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).
Beginning in 1997 with only five schools, UCLA CEED’s MESA Program currently serves 20 schools and over 800 students in the Los Angeles Unified and Inglewood Unified School Districts.

The UCLA MESA Center continues to work toward engaging and advancing the academic development of educationally disadvantaged student groups with low UC eligibility students in STEM. Each year, efforts are made to further support and enhance the MESA model through supplemental activities for MESA students, advisors, and parents and to increase students’ success and persistence in STEM. These programs include: Math and Science Tutoring to assist students in learning math and science concepts learned in the classes; Saturday Academies, to provide assistance on MESA projects; STEM competitions in the LA area, to gain hands-on experience; Financial Aid Workshops, to provide information on funding college; and pre college Summer Enrichment Programs, enhance student academic preparation for college.

Each MESA school site is supported by 1-2 teachers who serve as MESA advisors and coordinate STEM activities for enrolled students. In addition, MESA high school students benefit from the support of college counselors who have joined our team of MESA advisors. Culminating the MESA student experience each year is MESA Day. MESA Day is a regional event that engages students in STEM-based MESA competitions to test their design skills and math acuity. MESA projects provide the groundwork for the competitions that are offered during the event.
