Welcome to the UCLA CEED Program!
Jessica Martin-Gonzalez
CEED Associate Director
Jessica Martin-Gonzalez is on a mission to help students recognize the array of cultural strengths that they bring into the classroom and how those strengths can transform the field of Engineering and Computer Science.
Prior to joining CEED, Jessica was the Lead Coordinator for UCLA’s College Corps, a statewide stipend-based program that promotes civic and community engagement. There, she implemented a robust organizational structure, developed strengths-based programming in collaboration with other staff, and identified systems of support for Undocumented students. She has also led multiple initiatives at UC Berkeley and UCLA to create welcoming spaces for high-achieving underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students.
Before transitioning to higher education, Jessica worked with immigration law firms in the Bay Area and interpreted for political asylum interviews.
She enjoys connecting with other campus staff through UCLA’s BHIP program and hopes to lift up to 110 pounds by the end of the winter quarter. Jessica holds a B.A. Political Economy from UC Berkeley and a M.Ed. in Student Affairs from UCLA.
Please join us in welcoming Jessica to the CEED Program!
Congratulations to the graduating Class of 2023!
