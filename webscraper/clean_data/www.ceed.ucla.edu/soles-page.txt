SOLES is committed to the advancement of Latinx students in engineering and science through endeavors to stimulate intellectual pursuit through group studying, tutoring, and peer counseling for all members. SOLES organizes outreach events like
“Engineers in Training Day” and the “Junior Leadership Retreat” to inspire high school students from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue STEM. The organization is committed to making a difference in the community through tutoring and mentorship.
