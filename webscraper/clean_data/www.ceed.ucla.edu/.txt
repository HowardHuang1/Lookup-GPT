Our Mission
The Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering champions the academic and professional development of a community of low-income, first generation, historically underrepresented students in engineering and computer science fields to ensure equity and parity in the K-20- pathways that lead to engineering and computing degrees.

Since 1983, CEED has developed a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) K-20 pipeline strategy, which successfully promotes academic excellence in university and local pre-college communities. A hallmark of the CEED’s success is its critical transition programs that support students academically, professionally and personally to ensure students successfully complete their degrees and are ready to pursue graduate school or a career in the engineering and computer science fields. The program has a decades-long history of commitment to promoting diversity in the engineering and technology workforce, with 1804 CEED students graduating from the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering and pursuing careers in industry and academia.
UCLA CEED has been able to substantially narrow the retention gap between underrepresented minorities (URM) and non-URM engineering students. The University of California defines URM groups as American Indian, African American, Latino/a, Mexican American, and Pacific Islanders.
