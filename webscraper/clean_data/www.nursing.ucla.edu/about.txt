The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) was founded in 1919 and is the #1 public university in the country.
With a student body of about 38,000 students, UCLA is the largest university in California. Our faculty includes Nobel Laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners, multiple MacArthur fellows, and scores of national academy members. Interdisciplinary teaching and research is a particular strength, with initiatives in the arts, stem cells, and other biosciences, nanoscience, international studies, and the environment.
The UCLA School of Nursing has 605 students including 201 undergraduate students, 404 graduate students, 36 tenured faculty, research faculty and instructors and 49 adjunct faculty and lecturers. It is a small school within a large research university, giving the dual advantage of personally knowing students while providing them with the best a research university has to offer.
