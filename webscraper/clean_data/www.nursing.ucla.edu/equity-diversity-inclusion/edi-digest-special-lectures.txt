EDI Digest & Special Lectures
The EDI Digest provides students, staff, and faculty with resources with the goal of increasing shared understanding of how EDI transcends teaching, practice, research, and community service.
And, if you missed our recent or a past EDI Special Lecture, you can find links to them below. These presentations are focused on health-disparities and ideas related to equity, diversity, and inclusion.
