Nursing Student Organizations
UCLA student run organizations
are an essential part of the UCLA experience. These organizations create opportunities for leadership development, student engagement, encourage problem-solving, and introduce students to those with shared interests. Student groups help foster and create connections beyond the classroom and provide students a way to develop transferable skills that can help them in their future endeavors.
