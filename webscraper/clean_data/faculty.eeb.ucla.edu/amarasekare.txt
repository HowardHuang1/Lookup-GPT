About the lab
Welcome to the Amarasekare Lab! My research focuses on mechanisms that maintain biological diversity in variable environments.  I approach this issue from both an ecological and an evolutionary perspective, and explore it using a combination of observation, experimentation and mathematical modelling.  Through investigations of host-parasitoid and other multi-trophic interactions in variable environments, my research encompasses both basic and applied issues in Ecology.
