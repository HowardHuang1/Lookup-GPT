About the Program – UCLA Program in Computing
The Program in Computing (PIC) is part of a general UCLA mission whose goal is to provide students with the skills and knowledge required to effectively use computational tools to carry out scholarly work. This is not a “trade school” mission, but a mission undertaken out of recognition that students need to have a good set of computational skills to be productive participants in the educational and research activities at UCLA. In PIC, the topics of the courses taught concern the computational tools that are required, or likely to be required, by students within the College of Letters and Sciences at UCLA. While there is a focus on the needs of Letters and Sciences students, enrollment is open to all students, although undergraduate have first priority. The program is administered through the UCLA Department of Mathematics.
