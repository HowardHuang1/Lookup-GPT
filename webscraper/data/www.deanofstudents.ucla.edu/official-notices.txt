This procedure applies to grievances by students alleging disability-based discrimination by the University, as well as grievances alleging that the University failed to take appropriate steps to investigate disability discrimination, and to grievances by students alleging disability-based discriminatory conduct by students or non-affiliates where the alleged offending behavior occurred in University programs or activities.</p> <p>We have now issued an accompanying Guidance Document as Attachment B to Procedure 230.2, which is available at <a href="http://www.adminpolicies.ucla.edu/APP/Attachment?fileName=230-2-B">http://www.adminpolicies.ucla.edu/APP/Attachment?fileName=230-2-B</a>.This document is designed to assist administrators and staff involved in responding to disability-based discrimination grievances filed by students pursuant to UCLA Procedure 230.2. It outlines the steps of the grievance process and communicates the roles and responsibilities of the administrators and staff involved in the process.</p> <p>Formal training on the new procedure will be provided starting in Winter 2017.Inquiries regarding the University’s student-related nondiscrimination policies and procedures may be directed to the Office of the Dean of Students at 1104 Murphy Hall, by phone at (310) 825-3871, or by e-mail at <a href="mailto:dean@saonet.ucla.edu">dean@saonet.ucla.edu</a>.
