      <h3>Physics: Earning the PhD degree</h3>
      <p><p>For a comprehensive description of the PhD in Physics, consult the <a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/programs/physical-sciences/physics-and-astronomy-department/physics/">program 
      requirements</a>.</p>
      <h5>Course Requirements</h5>
      <p>Students are required to complete 36 units. Students fulfill the 36-unit requirement by taking the six core courses (24 units), two required 
      non-core courses (4 units) and two elective courses (8 units). No more than eight units may be chosen from Physics 596 and/or seminar courses. Physics 597 and 598 may 
      not be applied toward course requirements for the M.S. degree.</p>
      <p>Students are required to enroll in a minimum of 12 units each quarter and maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA.</p>
      <h5>Written Comprehensive Examination</h5>
      <!--<p>The written comprehensive examination consists of two four-hour sections given on consecutive days, and its scope is defined by the graduate physics material in 
      the six core courses (Physics 210A, 210B, 215A, 220, 221A, and 221B).</p>
      <p>The written comprehensive examination is offered once a year, in the week before the beginning of classes in Fall Quarter. Students entering the graduate program 
      in Fall Quarter are expected to take the written comprehensive examination before their fourth quarter of residence.</p>
      <p>Students are required to pass the written comprehensive examination at the PhD level. This level is determined by the Comprehensive Examination Committee for each 
      examination session. If students fail to pass the examination at the PhD level, they may take it a second time the next session it is given.</p>-->
      <p>The written comprehensive exam is described in the <a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/graduate-program-requirements/program-requirements-for-physics-and-astronomy-physics-7/">program 
      requirements</a>. For more information please contact the department's 
      graduate affairs office.</p>
      <p>Once a student has completed the required courses and passed the comprehensive exam at the MS level or above, they may file a 
      petition to receive an M.S. degree. For a comprehensive description of the Master’s in Physics, 
      <a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/programs/physical-sciences/physics-and-astronomy-department/physics/">consult the program 
      requirements</a>.</p>
      <h5>Doctoral Committee</h5>
      <p>Doctoral committees are arranged by the student before the oral qualifying examination. Students are encouraged to consult with their advisor for 
      recommendations on committee members.</p>
      <p>To nominate a doctoral committee, please consult the <a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/ucla/gasaa/doccommitteestandards.pdf">minimum standards for doctoral committees</a> 
      and complete the <a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/gasaa/library/docnomin.pdf">nomination of doctoral committee form</a>. The doctoral committee must be approved by Graduate 
      Division before the oral qualifying examination.</p>
      <h5>Oral Qualifying Examination</h5>
      <p>The oral qualifying examination is an oral presentation of the student’s proposed dissertation problem.</p>
      <p>To schedule the oral qualifying exam, contact your advisor’s administrative assistant to book a room and time for the exam. After you have scheduled the exam, complete 
      the <a href="https://computing.pa.ucla.edu/webform/preparation-qualifying-or-final-exam">preparation for oral qualifying exam form</a> 
      at least two weeks prior to the date of the actual exam.</p>
      <p>Upon the successful completion of their oral qualifying examination, students are advanced to candidacy. Full-time students are expected to advance to candidacy 
      by their 9th quarter in residence.</p>
      <h5>General Guidelines for the Oral Qualifying Exam</h5>
      <p>The qualifying oral exam is an opportunity to demonstrate to your committee that you have acquired an adequate command of your field and resources to produce original 
      and significant work. The time frame of the exam may vary between one to two hours depending on the discussion time for the committee. The presentation lasts about 30 
      minutes (about 15 slides, 2 minutes per slide). Expect interruptions from committee members in order to ask questions/clarify points and remember to leave time for 
      questions at the end as well.</p>
      <p>The presentation itself should cover the following key topics:</p>
      <p>1. An introduction to the science of your topic (i.e., why should someone be interested in what you are about to say?)</p>
      <p>2. What you've done so far. You will want to discuss background literature and preliminary results, if you have them. It is important to make clear what *you* did 
      when you are giving the background information.</p>
      <p>3. Next steps (i.e., what’s your plan for completing the project?). If there are any resources you are counting on (such as the repair or delivery of a big 
      laser) you should talk about that and if there is a chance you won't get it, what is your Plan B?</p>
      <p>4. Timeline for completion of project</p>
      <p>It is highly recommended that the student consult closely with the advisor about the contents of the examination.</p>
      <p>Other general advice:</p>
      <p>1. Never have any words, phrases, or plots that you do not understand at least "one sentence deeper". Anything on your slides is fair game for someone to 
      ask "What is xxx?"   If you don't know at all, that does not look good.</p>
      <p>2. Have nothing on the slides you do not need. They only distract and waste the time of the person in the audience trying to figure it out. So if for example 
      you take a slide from a publication and it has four curves on it but you only want to talk about one, white-box over the lines or points you are not going to 
      talk about.</p>
      <p>3a. *ALL* text and plots on your slides should be clearly legible. If axes numbers cannot be read, you can white-box them over and rewrite your own large 
      numbers.  Or use arrows and big numbers for values. If an axis is labeled with a complicated formula but you only need to say something simple such as "emittance", 
      replace it. If something is not legible and is not necessary, just remove it by cropping or white box. The person in the audience will be annoyed trying to read 
      fonts that are too small. If they are totally unreadable that is a bit insulting to the audience. (The only exception to this rule is if your point is to show 
      something is hopelessly complicated)</p>
      <p>3b. The corollary to rule #3 is that you should only have at most two plots per slide, but keep to one. *Extra* plots can go into backup slides.</p>
      <p>4. Slide area is valuable. Don't waste it with large repetitive designs etc. from the master. Make sure your plots use all available space even if it means 
      dragging a corner 10% bigger. Legibility goes as the square of the plot area.</p>
      <p>5. You need to give a practice talk at least twice. Preferably do it once with a friend and once with your advisor. If you advisor is asking basic questions 
      about your slides and it becomes clear he or she has not seen them before, that will really annoy the other committee members.</p>
      <p>Good luck!</p>
      <h5>Dissertation</strong></h5>
      <p>Every doctoral degree program requires the completion of an approved dissertation that demonstrates the student's ability to perform original, independent 
      research and constitutes a distinct contribution to knowledge in the principal field of study.</p>
      <h5>Final Oral Examination</strong></h5>
      <p>A final oral examination (i.e. defense) is required for all students in the program. Full-time students are expected to defend and submit their Ph.D. 
      dissertations by their 18th quarter in residence. To schedule your defense, consult and complete the <a href="https://computing.pa.ucla.edu/webform/preparation-qualifying-or-final-exam">preparation for final oral exam 
      form</a>.</p>

      two elective courses from the following course options: Astronomy 275, Astronomy 276, Astronomy 282, Astronomy 283, and Astronomy 286. Students are required to 
      enroll in a minimum of 12 units per quarter and maintain a 3.0 GPA.</p>
      <h5>Comprehensive Examination</h5>
      <p>The purpose of the comprehensive exam is to train students to perform research at the Ph.D. level and is designed to assess both research ability and general 
      knowledge of astronomy and physics at the graduate level.</p>
      <p>The comprehensive examination itself is comprised of a written component and an oral component. The written component is the culmination of the second-year research 
      project. The oral component is the presentation of the second-year research project. During the oral presentation, students are expected to respond to questions on their 
      research and to solve basic problems from all core areas of astrophysics. The oral presentation is conducted in the Spring quarter of students’ 2nd year by the 
      comprehensive examination committee, appointed by the vice chair and consisting of three members.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pa.ucla.edu/Comprehensive-Exam-Description-June-2020.pdf">Here is a detailed decription of the Astronomy comprehensive exam</a>.</p>
