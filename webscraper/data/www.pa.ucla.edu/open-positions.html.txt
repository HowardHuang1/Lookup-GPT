The successful candidate will engage in experimental research within the broad area of fast-ion physics in fusion research plasmas in spherical tokamaks. The successful candidate will analyze experimental data from the National Spherical Torus eXperiment Upgrade (NSTX-U, <a href="https://nstx-u.pppl.gov">https://nstx-u.pppl.gov</a>) spherical tokamak and its predecessor NSTX and perform related modeling and simulation to solve challenging problems in the area of wave-particle interactions and their consequences for fusion plasma performance. Energetic ions from high-power, high-energy neutral heating beams play a critical role in plasma heating and current drive. However, these energetic ions also drive waves with a diverse range of significant, sometimes negative, consequences for spherical tokamak performance that must be understood to advance the spherical tokamak as a fusion reactor concept. The successful candidate will work in close collaboration with other members of the PDG and the NSTX-U Research Team at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in Princeton (PPPL), NJ, USA, and disseminate the results of their research through presentations at international conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
      <p>Qualified candidates will have a Ph.D. in Physics or a related field earned within the past ten years and no more than five years of cumulative postdoctoral research experience, including at other institutions. The candidate should have a demonstrated background directly applicable to the area of research. Experience with both data analysis and modeling or simulation is advantageous. Experience with programming for these tasks is advantageous, particularly with Python, NumPy, and SciPy.</p>
